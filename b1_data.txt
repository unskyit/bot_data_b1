# --- PDF Compressor Tool Specific Queries (Adding more detail and variants) ---
What is the PDF Compressor tool? :: The PDF Compressor tool helps you reduce the file size of your PDF documents, primarily by optimizing the images contained within them. You select your PDF(s), choose a compression level or custom settings, and download the smaller output file(s). Want to get started? Ask `How to use PDF Compressor`.
How to use PDF Compressor? :: Click 'Choose PDF File(s)', select one or more PDFs, choose a compression preset (like 'Balanced' or 'Smaller Size') or configure advanced settings, and click the button to compress and download the output. Want to reduce file size? Ask `Reduce PDF file size`.
Guide on compressing PDF files? :: Load your PDF file(s) into the PDF Compressor tool, select a compression preset (Good, Balanced, Low, Extreme) or customize advanced options (DPI, image quality, grayscale), and initiate the compression and download. Ask about batch compression. Ask `Compress Multiple PDFs`.
Tell me about the PDF Compressor feature? :: The PDF Compressor re-renders each page of your PDF as an image at a lower resolution and/or quality, resulting in a smaller PDF file size. It works well for PDFs containing many large images. Ask about how it works. Ask `How does PDF compression work here?`.
How can I make my PDF smaller? :: Use the PDF Compressor tool. Load your PDF, choose a compression level, and download the compressed version.

How does PDF compression work here? :: This PDF Compressor works by rasterizing (converting into a flat image) each page of the original PDF at a specified resolution (DPI). It then compresses these rasterized images and embeds them into a new, smaller PDF file. Text and vector graphics become part of these images. Want to know the presets? Ask `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Explain how the PDF file size is reduced? :: The tool reduces size by converting PDF pages into images at a lower quality or resolution.
Mechanism of PDF compression? :: Pages are converted to images, then those images are optimized and re-embedded in a new PDF.
Why does compression affect text sometimes? :: Because the pages are converted to images, text and vector graphics are flattened into pixels, which can reduce their sharpness, especially at lower DPI settings.
Compression method used? :: The tool uses page rasterization (PDF to image) and image compression.

PDF Compression Preset options :: The PDF Compressor tool offers four standard compression presets: 'Good Quality' (~150 DPI), 'Balanced' (~120 DPI), 'Smaller Size' (~96 DPI, applies grayscale), and 'Extreme' (~72 DPI, applies grayscale, lowest quality). Clicking a card selects that preset. Want to set custom quality? Ask `Advanced PDF Compression settings`.
What are the different compression levels? :: Good Quality, Balanced, Smaller Size, and Extreme.
Explain the compression presets? :: These presets adjust the internal DPI (resolution) and image quality used when re-rendering each PDF page.
How do the presets differ? :: They differ in the balance between file size reduction and output quality, primarily controlled by the DPI and whether grayscale is applied.
Which preset should I choose? :: 'Balanced' is a good general choice. 'Smaller Size' or 'Extreme' are for maximum reduction (expect quality loss), while 'Good Quality' prioritizes clarity.

Advanced PDF Compression settings :: Click the 'Advanced Compression Settings' button below the preset cards to reveal manual options for controlling compression. Here you can set the 'Page Render DPI', 'Image Quality (0.1-1.0)' for the embedded images, enable/disable 'Convert Images to Grayscale', and set the 'Output Filename Suffix'. These settings override the presets when enabled. Want to apply these to a batch? Ask `Apply advanced settings to batch PDFs`.
How to manually control compression? :: Click 'Advanced Compression Settings'.
Customize PDF compression? :: Use the advanced settings for manual control over DPI, image quality, and grayscale.
Manual DPI for PDF compression? :: Set the 'Page Render DPI' in the advanced options.
Manual Image Quality for PDF compression? :: Set the 'Image Quality (0.1-1.0)' in the advanced options.

Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor :: In the PDF Compressor's 'Advanced Compression Settings', the 'Page Render DPI' determines the resolution (dots per inch) at which each page of the original PDF is converted into a raster image. A lower DPI (like 72 or 96) results in a much smaller output file but means the text and images will appear less sharp. A higher DPI (like 150 or 300) retains more detail but results in larger files.
What does DPI mean in PDF compression? :: DPI is the resolution used when turning each PDF page into an image for the compressed output.
How does DPI affect file size? :: Lower DPI reduces the number of pixels per page, leading to smaller images and thus a smaller final PDF size.
How does DPI affect quality? :: Lower DPI means less detail, so text and images can look less sharp or pixelated in the output PDF.
Recommended DPI for web? :: 72 or 96 DPI is often sufficient for web viewing, but text may not be crisp.

Image Quality Slider in PDF Compressor :: In the PDF Compressor's 'Advanced Compression Settings', the 'Image Quality (0.1-1.0)' slider appears. This controls the compression applied to the JPEG images that are generated from each page. A value closer to 1.0 means higher quality and less compression (larger file), while a value closer to 0.1 means lower quality and more compression (smaller file, more artifacts).
What does the Image Quality slider do? :: It controls the compression level of the images created from the PDF pages.
Adjusting compression level for images in PDF? :: Use the 'Image Quality (0.1-1.0)' slider in advanced settings.
Trade-off between quality and size for compressed PDF? :: The 'Image Quality' slider lets you fine-tune this; lower numbers mean smaller size, potentially lower quality.
How to make the images in the compressed PDF smaller? :: Reduce the 'Image Quality' value.

Convert Images to Grayscale in PDF Compressor :: In the PDF Compressor's 'Advanced Compression Settings', checking the 'Convert Images to Grayscale' box will convert all images on the pages to black and white during the rasterization process.

Warning about splitting into pixels? :: Yes, see the 'Image Splitter single pixel warning'.

Image Splitter single pixel warning :: When you enable the 'Split into single pixels' option in the Image Splitter, the tool calculates the total number of pixels (width x height) of the currently active image. If this number is very large (over 100,000), a warning message appears to inform you that processing might be very slow, resource-intensive, or could potentially crash your browser due to the vast number of tiny output files.
What is the warning for single pixel split? :: It warns that processing can be slow or cause issues due to the large number of pieces.
Why does single pixel split give a warning? :: Because it can create tens or hundreds of thousands of tiny image files.
Is splitting into pixels dangerous? :: It can be resource-intensive, potentially freezing or crashing your browser, especially for large images.
Warning about too many pieces? :: This warning appears with single pixel split for large images.

Border/Spacing options for split pieces :: In the 'Piece Styling & Output' section of the Image Splitter tool, you can set a 'Border/Spacing Width (px)'.

Choose PNG or WEBP if you need transparency (e.g., for transparent borders). You can also select different quality levels for JPEG and WEBP.
What file type can the split pieces be? :: PNG, JPEG, or WEBP.
Save split parts as JPG? :: Yes, select 'image/jpeg' as the 'Output Format'.
Save split parts as PNG? :: Yes, select 'image/png' as the 'Output Format'.
Save split parts as WEBP? :: Yes, select 'image/webp' as the 'Output Format'.

Filename Pattern for Split Pieces :: In the Image Splitter's 'Piece Styling & Output' options, you can define a pattern for the names of the output image files. Use placeholders like {name} (base name of the input file), {orig_ext} (original file extension), {row} (row index, starting from 0), {col} (column index, starting from 0), {index} (the piece number in the grid, 0-based), and {ext} (the output file extension). Example: `{name}_r{row}_c{col}.{ext}` will produce files like `myimage_r0_c0.png`, `myimage_r0_c1.png`, etc.
Custom filename pattern for split output? :: Use the 'Filename Pattern' input.
Renaming the individual pieces after splitting? :: You can define a pattern using placeholders.
How are the split pieces named? :: They are named based on the filename pattern you specify, using placeholders for context like row and column.

# --- PDF Compressor Tool Specific Queries (Adding more detail and variants) ---
What is the PDF Compressor tool? :: The PDF Compressor tool helps you reduce the file size of your PDF documents, primarily by optimizing the images contained within them. You select your PDF(s), choose a compression level or custom settings, and download the smaller output file(s). Want to get started? Ask `How to use PDF Compressor`.
How to use PDF Compressor? :: Click 'Choose PDF File(s)', select one or more PDFs, choose a compression preset (like 'Balanced' or 'Smaller Size') or configure advanced settings, and click the button to compress and download the output. Want to reduce file size? Ask `Reduce PDF file size`.
Guide on compressing PDF files? :: Load your PDF file(s) into the PDF Compressor tool, select a compression preset (Good, Balanced, Low, Extreme) or customize advanced options (DPI, image quality, grayscale), and initiate the compression and download. Ask about batch compression. Ask `Compress Multiple PDFs`.
Tell me about the PDF Compressor feature? :: The PDF Compressor re-renders each page of your PDF as an image at a lower resolution and/or quality, resulting in a smaller PDF file size. It works well for PDFs containing many large images. Ask about how it works. Ask `How does PDF compression work here?`.
How can I make my PDF smaller? :: Use the PDF Compressor tool. Load your PDF, choose a compression level, and download the compressed version.

How does PDF compression work here? :: This PDF Compressor works by rasterizing (converting into a flat image) each page of the original PDF at a specified resolution (DPI). It then compresses these rasterized images and embeds them into a new, smaller PDF file. Text and vector graphics become part of these images. Want to know the presets? Ask `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Explain how the PDF file size is reduced? :: The tool reduces size by converting PDF pages into images at a lower quality or resolution.
Mechanism of PDF compression? :: Pages are converted to images, then those images are optimized and re-embedded in a new PDF.
Why does compression affect text sometimes? :: Because the pages are converted to images, text and vector graphics are flattened into pixels, which can reduce their sharpness, especially at lower DPI settings.
Compression method used? :: The tool uses page rasterization (PDF to image) and image compression.

PDF Compression Preset options :: The PDF Compressor tool offers four standard compression presets: 'Good Quality' (~150 DPI), 'Balanced' (~120 DPI), 'Smaller Size' (~96 DPI, applies grayscale), and 'Extreme' (~72 DPI, applies grayscale, lowest quality). Clicking a card selects that preset. Want to set custom quality? Ask `Advanced PDF Compression settings`.
What are the different compression levels? :: Good Quality, Balanced, Smaller Size, and Extreme.
Explain the compression presets? :: These presets adjust the internal DPI (resolution) and image quality used when re-rendering each PDF page.
How do the presets differ? :: They differ in the balance between file size reduction and output quality, primarily controlled by the DPI and whether grayscale is applied.
Which preset should I choose? :: 'Balanced' is a good general choice. 'Smaller Size' or 'Extreme' are for maximum reduction (expect quality loss), while 'Good Quality' prioritizes clarity.

Advanced PDF Compression settings :: Click the 'Advanced Compression Settings' button below the preset cards to reveal manual options for controlling compression. Here you can set the 'Page Render DPI', 'Image Quality (0.1-1.0)' for the embedded images, enable/disable 'Convert Images to Grayscale', and set the 'Output Filename Suffix'. These settings override the presets when enabled. Want to apply these to a batch? Ask `Apply advanced settings to batch PDFs`.
How to manually control compression? :: Click 'Advanced Compression Settings'.
Customize PDF compression? :: Use the advanced settings for manual control over DPI, image quality, and grayscale.
Manual DPI for PDF compression? :: Set the 'Page Render DPI' in the advanced options.
Manual Image Quality for PDF compression? :: Set the 'Image Quality (0.1-1.0)' in the advanced options.

Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor :: In the PDF Compressor's 'Advanced Compression Settings', the 'Page Render DPI' determines the resolution (dots per inch) at which each page of the original PDF is converted into a raster image. A lower DPI (like 72 or 96) results in a much smaller output file but means the text and images will appear less sharp. A higher DPI (like 150 or 300) retains more detail but results in larger files.
What does DPI mean in PDF compression? :: DPI is the resolution used when turning each PDF page into an image for the compressed output.
How does DPI affect file size? :: Lower DPI reduces the number of pixels per page, leading to smaller images and thus a smaller final PDF size.
How does DPI affect quality? :: Lower DPI means less detail, so text and images can look less sharp or pixelated in the output PDF.
Recommended DPI for web? :: 72 or 96 DPI is often sufficient for web viewing, but text may not be crisp.

Image Quality Slider in PDF Compressor :: In the PDF Compressor's 'Advanced Compression Settings', the 'Image Quality (0.1-1.0)' slider appears. This controls the compression applied to the JPEG images that are generated from each page. A value closer to 1.0 means higher quality and less compression (larger file), while a value closer to 0.1 means lower quality and more compression (smaller file, more artifacts).
What does the Image Quality slider do? :: It controls the compression level of the images created from the PDF pages.
Adjusting compression level for images in PDF? :: Use the 'Image Quality (0.1-1.0)' slider in advanced settings.
Trade-off between quality and size for compressed PDF? :: The 'Image Quality' slider lets you fine-tune this; lower numbers mean smaller size, potentially lower quality.
How to make the images in the compressed PDF smaller? :: Reduce the 'Image Quality' value.

Convert Images to Grayscale in PDF Compressor :: In the PDF Compressor's 'Advanced Compression Settings', checking the 'Convert Images to Grayscale' box will convert all images on the pages to black and white during the rasterization process.

What does the angle step do? :: It determines the increment between rotations in the sequence.
Control rotation increment? :: Use the 'Angle Step' input.
How many degrees between rotations in the sequence? :: Set the 'Angle Step'.
Stepping through angles in the sequence? :: The 'Angle Step' defines the value added at each step.

Flip images within the rotation sequence :: When 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence' is enabled, you can optionally check 'Flip Horizontal' or 'Flip Vertical'. If checked, *every* image generated in the rotation sequence for each input file will also have that corresponding flip applied.
Apply flip to all images in the sequence? :: Check 'Flip Horizontal' and/or 'Flip Vertical' in the advanced sequence options.
Flip each generated rotation? :: The advanced sequence settings allow applying flips to every image in the sequence.
Horizontal flip during sequence generation? :: Check the 'advFlipHorizontalCheckbox'.
Vertical flip during sequence generation? :: Check the 'advFlipVerticalCheckbox'.

Estimated Images per Sequence File :: When 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence' is enabled, the tool calculates and displays an estimate of how many separate output image files will be generated for *each* selected input image based on your 'Start Angle', 'End Angle', and 'Angle Step' settings. The total number of files in the final ZIP will be this number multiplied by the count of input files you select for processing.
How many images will one input file produce with the sequence? :: Look at the 'Estimated images per input file' display.
Estimate output count per image? :: The tool shows an estimate based on the sequence settings.
Number of images from the rotation sequence? :: The 'Estimated images per input file' shows how many outputs one input file will produce.
What does the estimate mean? :: It's the count of images per input file generated by the rotation sequence.

Rotator Flipper Output Filename options :: In the Image Rotator & Flipper tool, expand the 'Advanced Options' section. Here you can enter a base name in the 'Rename file (basename)' field. When you process files, the tool will use this base name and add details about the transformation (like rotation angle, _fh for horizontal flip, _fv for vertical flip) and the correct output file extension (.png, .jpg, or .webp) to create unique filenames for each output file in the ZIP.
Custom filename for Rotator Flipper output? :: Use the 'Rename file (basename)' field in the advanced options.
Renaming the transformed images? :: You can set a base name for the output files in the advanced options.
How are the output files named? :: They are named using the specified base name (or original name if none is set), plus transformation details and the extension.

What happens to image quality in Image to PDF? :: The Image to PDF tool aims to embed your images without significant quality loss by default. However, if you set very large margins or a very small page size relative to your high-resolution image, the image might be scaled down to fit, which could affect sharpness. Ask about `Image Scaling options PDF`.
Does Image to PDF reduce image quality? :: By default, it tries not to, but if you force a large image onto a small page size with big margins, the image might be scaled down, potentially impacting its visual quality. Ask about `PDF Page Size options`.
Image quality after converting to PDF? :: The tool aims to maintain quality, but scaling down a large image to fit the page can cause some loss. Ask about `Image Scaling options PDF`.
Will my pictures lose quality when I put them in a PDF? :: The tool tries to preserve quality, but fitting very large images onto smaller PDF pages can sometimes result in a visual quality change due to scaling. Ask about `PDF Page Size options`.
Is the image quality preserved in the output PDF? :: The tool attempts to preserve quality, but scaling due to page size or margins might affect it. Ask about `Set PDF page margins`.

Can I combine images of different sizes into one PDF? :: Yes, the Image to PDF tool can combine images of various dimensions. Each image will be placed on its own page according to the 'Page Size' and 'Image Scaling' settings you choose. Ask about `Image Scaling options PDF`.
Mix image sizes in a PDF? :: Yes, the tool handles images of different sizes by placing each on its own page. Ask about `PDF Page Size options`.
Combine photos with different dimensions? :: The Image to PDF tool accommodates images with different widths and heights. Ask about `Image to PDF tool guide`.
Put small and large images in the same PDF? :: Yes, the tool can combine images regardless of their original size. Ask about `Image Scaling options PDF`.

Downscaling images for PDF pages? :: The tool automatically scales down large images if needed to fit the page and margins. Ask about `Image Scaling options PDF`.

Can I add the original image filename to the PDF? :: The Image to PDF tool's page numbering has an 'Original X / Current Y' format option which uses the original import order index. However, embedding the *full filename* onto the page or as part of the PDF metadata is not a direct option within this tool. Ask about `Page numbering display options Image to PDF`.
Include the filename on the PDF page? :: The tool doesn't have a direct option to put the filename on the page itself. Ask about `Image to PDF Metadata`.
Filename in PDF output? :: Not directly on the page, but you can add metadata. Ask about `Image to PDF Metadata`.
Embed original filename? :: The tool focuses on embedding the image content and standard PDF metadata, not the source filename within the PDF itself. Ask about `Image to PDF Metadata`.

How does the 'Original X / Current Y' page number format work? :: In the Image to PDF tool, this format uses the index of the image *in the original list you selected* as the first number (X), and the final page number *in the generated PDF* as the second number (Y). This is useful if you reordered images after selecting them and want to track their original position. Ask about `Page numbering display options Image to PDF`.
Explain the 'Original X / Current Y' page number :: It shows the original import order and the final page number. Ask about `Page numbering display options Image to PDF`.
Original index vs final page number? :: The 'Original X / Current Y' format shows both. Ask about `Page numbering display options Image to PDF`.
Track original image position in PDF? :: Use the 'Original X / Current Y' page number format. Ask about `Page numbering display options Image to PDF`.

Can I rotate images *before* they go into the PDF? :: No, the Image to PDF tool does not have built-in image editing features like rotation before conversion. You would need to rotate your images using a separate tool (like the Image Rotate & Flip tool!) or software beforehand. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.
Rotate pictures before putting them in PDF? :: The Image to PDF tool doesn't rotate; use a separate tool first. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.
Image rotation before PDF conversion? :: No built-in rotation in this tool. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.
Need to rotate image then add to PDF :: Rotate it first with another tool, then add it to Image to PDF. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.

What if I select a ZIP with non-image files? :: If you select a ZIP file in the Image to PDF tool that contains files other than supported image formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP), the tool will simply ignore the non-image files and only process the images it finds. Ask about `Supported image formats in ZIPs`.
ZIP contains non-images :: The tool will ignore files that aren't JPG, PNG, or WEBP inside the ZIP. Ask about `Supported image formats in ZIPs`.
ZIP with other files :: Only images are processed from the ZIP. Ask about `Supported image formats in ZIPs`.
Files other than images in the ZIP :: They will be skipped by the tool. Ask about `Supported image formats in ZIPs`.

# --- Deeper Look: PDF Compressor ---
How does compression affect different types of content in PDF? :: This PDF Compressor primarily targets images by re-rendering them. Text and vector graphics are usually flattened into the rasterized page image. If the original PDF has complex layers or interactive elements, these might not be preserved correctly in the compressed version. Ask about `How PDF Compression Works`.
Impact of compression on text quality? :: At lower DPI settings, text flattened into the image can appear less crisp or pixelated. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Does compression affect vector graphics? :: Vector graphics will be converted to pixels as part of the page image, potentially losing their scalability benefits depending on the DPI. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Complex PDFs after compression? :: Features like form fields, links, or layers might not be preserved as pages are flattened to images. Ask about `How PDF Compression Works`.
Compression with interactive elements? :: Features beyond basic page content might not transfer correctly after rasterization. Ask about `How PDF Compression Works`.

Can the PDF Compressor make searchable PDFs? :: Since this tool rasterizes each page into a flat image, the text becomes part of the image pixels. It will *not* preserve or create searchable text layers. The output PDF will likely not have selectable or searchable text unless the original was an image-only PDF with an existing searchable layer (which is unlikely to be preserved). Ask about `How PDF Compression Works`.
Does compression preserve searchable text? :: No, this tool flattens text into images, removing searchable text layers. Ask about `How PDF Compression Works`.
Will the compressed PDF have searchable text? :: Unlikely, as text is turned into pixels. Ask about `How PDF Compression Works`.
Text search after compression? :: Text will likely not be searchable in the compressed PDF. Ask about `How PDF Compression Works`.

Choosing between DPI and Image Quality in advanced settings? :: In the PDF Compressor's advanced options, 'Page Render DPI' affects the *resolution* of the page image (how many pixels represent the original page), while 'Image Quality' affects the *compression* of that resulting image (how much data is removed from the pixels). Reducing DPI usually has a more dramatic impact on file size but can make everything look worse. Reducing Image Quality for a given DPI makes the image file smaller but might introduce compression artifacts (like blockiness). Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor` or `Image Quality Slider in PDF Compressor`.
DPI vs Image Quality :: DPI sets resolution, Image Quality sets compression of the resulting image. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Impact of DPI vs Quality slider :: DPI changes pixel count, Quality changes how those pixels are compressed. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Which setting reduces size more, DPI or Quality? :: Lowering DPI often has a bigger size impact, but also a bigger visual impact. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Difference between DPI and Image Quality slider? :: One is about resolution, the other is about image compression applied to the pixels at that resolution. Ask about `Image Quality Slider in PDF Compressor`.

Why might the compressed PDF look different from the original? :: Because the tool converts pages to images, slight differences in rendering (fonts, layout, colors) can occur, especially at lower DPI settings or if the original PDF had complex graphical elements or specific fonts not commonly available. Compression artifacts might also be visible at lower image quality settings. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Compressed PDF looks different :: Differences can occur due to rasterization and settings like DPI. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Output PDF doesn't look exactly like original :: Rasterization and compression can introduce slight variations. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Visual changes after compression? :: Yes, due to page rendering and image compression. Ask about `Image Quality Slider in PDF Compressor`.
Colors look different in compressed PDF :: Color rendering during rasterization or compression artifacts might be the cause. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.

Can I compress image-only PDFs? :: Yes, the PDF Compressor works well on image-only PDFs (PDFs where each page is just a single image). It will re-render these pages as images at your specified settings, which can still result in significant size reduction if you lower the DPI or image quality. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Compress a PDF that's just images :: Yes, the tool is effective for those. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
PDF with scanned pages compression :: The tool is suitable for scanned PDFs as they are essentially image-based. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Image based PDF compression :: Yes, the tool works by processing page images. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.

# --- Deeper Look: PDF to Image ---
Does PDF to Image preserve the original PDF layout perfectly? :: The PDF to Image Converter aims to render each PDF page as accurately as possible based on its instructions, but very complex layouts, specific fonts not embedded in the PDF, or unusual graphical elements might have minor rendering differences in the output image compared to viewing the PDF in a dedicated PDF reader. Ask about `How does PDF to Image conversion work?`.
Output image looks slightly different than PDF :: Minor rendering differences can occur. Ask about `How does PDF to Image conversion work?`.
Layout changes when converting PDF to image? :: Major layout shouldn't change, but subtle rendering might differ. Ask about `How does PDF to Image conversion work?`.
Fonts look weird in the image from PDF :: If the PDF uses uncommon fonts that aren't embedded, the browser might substitute them during rendering. Ask about `How does PDF to Image conversion work?`.
Rendering differences PDF to image :: Small variations can happen depending on the PDF content and browser rendering. Ask about `How does PDF to Image conversion work?`.

How does PDF to Image handle scanned PDFs vs. born-digital PDFs? :: The tool works by rendering pages. For scanned PDFs (which are essentially images), it renders the existing image content. For born-digital PDFs (with text and vectors), it converts those into pixels. The output quality primarily depends on the chosen DPI/Max Dimension and image format/quality, less so on whether it was originally scanned or digital, though original quality matters. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.
Scanned PDF to image conversion :: The tool can convert scanned PDFs, treating each page as an image source. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.
Born-digital PDF to image :: The tool converts text and vectors to pixels when converting. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.
Converting PDFs that are just images? :: Yes, the tool renders those images. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.

What is the best quality setting for converting PDF to Image? :: 'High' quality (300 DPI) is generally best for print or detailed use. 'Medium' (150 DPI) is good for standard use. 'Low' (72 DPI) is suitable for web viewing where small file size is critical, but text might be less clear. Custom 'Max Dimension' gives you pixel control. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.
Highest quality for PDF to Image :: Use the 'High' preset (300 DPI) or a high 'Max Dimension'. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.
Best resolution for PDF to image? :: 'High' (300 DPI) is typically considered high resolution for images from PDF. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.
Recommended quality for PDF to image? :: 'Medium' (150 DPI) is a good balance. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.
Quality for converting PDF pages to high-res images? :: Use the 'High' preset or set a large 'Max Dimension'. Ask about `PDF to Image Quality options`.

Can I convert only pages with images? :: No, the 'Page Range' option in the PDF to Image Converter selects pages by their number in the PDF, not by their content type. The tool will attempt to convert *all* content on the specified pages into an image. Ask about `How to select pages from PDF`.
Convert only pages with pictures :: The tool converts pages by number, not content type. Ask about `How to select pages from PDF`.
Skip pages without images :: The tool doesn't have a feature to skip pages based on content type. Ask about `How to select pages from PDF`.
Convert just pages that have pictures :: You must specify the page numbers where pictures are located. Ask about `How to select pages from PDF`.

What if the original PDF page has transparent elements? :: If the original PDF page contains transparent areas or elements, and you select an output format that supports transparency (PNG or WEBP) and check the 'Transparent' background box, those transparent areas should be preserved in the output image. Otherwise (using JPEG or disabling transparency), transparent areas will be filled with the chosen background color. Ask about `Transparent background PDF to Image`.
Transparency from PDF to image? :: Yes, if you use PNG or WEBP and enable transparency. Ask about `Transparent background PDF to Image`.
Handle transparent objects in PDF conversion? :: Use PNG or WEBP output and check the transparency box. Ask about `Transparent background PDF to Image`.
Transparent areas become solid color? :: Yes, if you use JPEG or don't enable transparency for PNG/WEBP. Ask about `Transparent background PDF to Image`.

Can I get a single image containing multiple pages from a PDF? :: No, the PDF to Image Converter produces a separate image file for *each* converted page. To combine multiple pages into one image, you would first convert the desired pages to images, and then use the Image Collage tool. Ask about `Image Collage tool guide`.
Combine PDF pages into one image :: Convert pages to images first, then use the Collage tool. Ask about `Image Collage tool guide`.
Multiple PDF pages in one image file :: No, the output is one image per page. Ask about `Image Collage tool guide`.

# --- Deeper Look: Image Splitter ---
What happens if the image dimensions aren't perfectly divisible by the number of rows/columns? :: The Image Splitter calculates the piece dimensions by taking the floor (rounding down) of the image width divided by columns and height divided by rows. The pieces in the last column and last row will take up any remaining pixels, meaning they might be slightly wider or taller than the other pieces to ensure the entire image is covered without overlap or gaps. Ask about `How splitting works`.
Image dimensions not divisible :: Pieces in the last row/column get the leftover pixels. Ask about `How splitting works`.
Split doesn't divide evenly :: The tool adjusts the last pieces to fit the remaining pixels. Ask about `How splitting works`.
Pieces have slightly different sizes :: Yes, the last pieces might be larger if the dimensions aren't perfectly divisible. Ask about `How splitting works`.
Grid split with uneven dimensions :: The last pieces in the grid absorb the remainder. Ask about `How splitting works`.

How splitting works :: The Image Splitter divides the original image into a grid. It calculates the width and height of each piece by dividing the total image dimensions by the number of columns and rows, rounding down. The pieces in the last column and row are adjusted to include any remaining pixels. Each piece, including the optional border, is then saved as a separate image file. Ask about `Border/Spacing options for split pieces`.
Explain the splitting process :: The image is divided into a grid, and each section is saved as a separate image file. Ask about `Border/Spacing options for split pieces`.
Mechanism of image splitting :: The tool calculates grid coordinates and extracts each section as a new image. Ask about `Border/Spacing options for split pieces`.
How does the tool divide the image :: It uses the number of rows and columns to calculate the size and position of each piece. Ask about `Border/Spacing options for split pieces`.

Can I split an image into pieces that overlap? :: No, the Image Splitter tool creates pieces that fit together like tiles in a grid without overlapping or leaving gaps (aside from the optional border/spacing added around each piece). Ask about `Border/Spacing options for split pieces`.
Overlap in split pieces? :: No, the pieces are cut to fit precisely next to each other (plus border). Ask about `Border/Spacing options for split pieces`.
Pieces overlap? :: The tool creates non-overlapping pieces. Ask about `Border/Spacing options for split pieces`.

Can I specify the size of the pieces instead of the grid size? :: No, the Image Splitter tool works by defining the grid (rows and columns, or single pixels). The size of the output pieces is *calculated* based on the original image dimensions and the chosen grid size. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.
Define piece size instead of grid :: No, you define the grid, and piece size is calculated. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.
Input desired piece dimensions? :: The tool takes rows/columns as input, not specific piece dimensions. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.

What happens if I split into single pixels for a very large image? :: Splitting into single pixels for a high-resolution image will generate a vast number of tiny image files (e.g., a 1000x1000 image results in 1,000,000 files). This can overwhelm your browser's memory and processing power, likely causing it to become unresponsive or crash. A warning is displayed for very large images. Ask about `Image Splitter single pixel warning`.
Splitting large image into pixels :: This will create a huge number of tiny files and might crash your browser. Ask about `Image Splitter single pixel warning`.
Too many pieces generated :: This happens with single pixel split on large images. Ask about `Image Splitter single pixel warning`.
Browser freezes with single pixel split :: This is likely due to generating too many files and exceeding memory. Ask about `Image Splitter single pixel warning`.

Can I apply different settings to different images in a batch? :: No, the Image Splitter tool applies the *same* splitting options (mode, rows, columns, border, output format, filename pattern) to *all* images you select for processing in a batch. You cannot configure individual settings per file within the batch. Ask about `Batch Processing`.
Different split settings for different images in batch :: No, the same settings are applied to all selected files. Ask about `Batch Processing`.
Process batch with varied split settings :: Not possible in this tool; settings apply to all selected. Ask about `Batch Processing`.

# --- Deeper Look: Image Rotate & Flip ---
What happens to the image dimensions after rotation? :: If you rotate an image by an angle that is not a multiple of 90 degrees (like 45°), the canvas size needs to increase to contain the rotated image without cropping. The tool calculates the minimum size needed for the canvas to fit the rotated image entirely, so the output image dimensions will be larger than the original's width and height. Rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° (and multiples) will result in output dimensions that are the same as the original's width/height, just possibly swapped. Ask about `How rotation affects dimensions`.
Dimensions change after rotation :: Yes, unless it's 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees. Ask about `How rotation affects dimensions`.
Image gets bigger when I rotate it? :: Yes, for angles that are not multiples of 90 degrees, the canvas size expands to fit the whole rotated image. Ask about `How rotation affects dimensions`.
New dimensions after rotating image? :: The tool calculates the new width and height needed to contain the rotated image without cropping. Ask about `How rotation affects dimensions`.
Image size increases on rotation? :: The canvas size increases to prevent cropping for non-90-degree rotations. Ask about `How rotation affects dimensions`.

How rotation affects dimensions :: When an image is rotated by an angle that isn't 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees (or multiples thereof), the output image's canvas will be larger than the original dimensions to ensure no part of the rotated image is cut off. The tool calculates the minimum bounding box for the rotated image. Ask about `Image Rotator Flipper Preview`.
Explain the dimension change on rotation :: For angles not 0/90/180/270, the output canvas is larger to fit the rotated image. Ask about `Image Rotator Flipper Preview`.
Why does the output have different dimensions when rotated? :: To prevent cropping of the rotated image content. Ask about `Image Rotator Flipper Preview`.
Calculating new dimensions after rotation :: The tool determines the smallest canvas that can contain the image after rotation. Ask about `Image Rotator Flipper Preview`.

Can I rotate by decimal angles? :: Yes, the 'Rotation Angle' input field in the Image Rotator & Flipper tool accepts decimal values (e.g., 45.5, -10.25). The preview will show the rotation accordingly. Ask about `Rotate image by custom angle`.
Decimal rotation angles? :: Yes, the input supports decimals. Ask about `Rotate image by custom angle`.
Rotate by fractional degrees? :: Yes, enter the decimal value in the input. Ask about `Rotate image by custom angle`.
Precise rotation angle? :: You can use decimal values for precise rotation. Ask about `Rotate image by custom angle`.

Does flipping affect image dimensions? :: No, applying a horizontal or vertical flip in the Image Rotator & Flipper tool does *not* change the overall dimensions (width and height) of the image. It only mirrors the image content within those dimensions. Ask about `Flip image horizontally or vertically`.
Image dimensions change after flip? :: No, flipping only mirrors the content, not the dimensions. Ask about `Flip image horizontally or vertically`.
Does flipping resize the image? :: No, flipping does not resize the image; it just mirrors the content. Ask about `Flip image horizontally or vertically`.

Can I apply a different rotation/flip to each image in a batch? :: By default, the rotation angle and flip settings you set apply to *all* selected images in a batch. If you need different transformations for each image, you would need to process them individually. However, the 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence' allows generating *multiple* outputs with different rotations *per* input file. Ask about `Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence`.
Different settings for images in batch? :: No, settings apply to all selected files unless using the advanced sequence. Ask about `Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence`.
Process batch with different transformations? :: The same rotation and flip settings apply to all selected files in a standard batch. Ask about `Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence`.
Apply unique rotation to each image in a batch? :: Not directly with standard batch; you'd process individually or use the advanced sequence to generate variations. Ask about `Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence`.

How does the 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence' estimate work? :: When you enable the advanced sequence, the tool calculates the number of angles generated between your 'Start Angle' and 'End Angle' based on the 'Angle Step'. The 'Estimated images per input file' is simply this count of angles. The total output is this number multiplied by the count of input files you select. The estimate does not account for file size, only the number of outputs. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.
Estimate in advanced sequence explained :: It's the number of images generated per input file based on start/end/step angles. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.
How is the number of sequence images calculated? :: Based on the start, end, and step angles. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.
Does the estimate account for file size? :: No, the estimate is only the count of images per input file. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.

What if I set the Angle Step to 0 in the Advanced Sequence? :: If the Angle Step is set to 0, the tool will typically just generate one image per input file, rotated by the 'Start Angle', unless the sequence range implies otherwise (like start != end with step 0, which is usually treated as 0 images or an error). It won't create a sequence of images at the same angle repeatedly. The estimate should show '1' if Start Angle is a valid number. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.
Angle step is zero :: It usually means only one image is generated per input file at the start angle. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.
Step 0 in rotation sequence :: This typically results in a single output per input at the start angle. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.

Add password to PDF from images? :: No, this tool doesn't support adding passwords. Ask about `safety and privacy`.
Encrypt PDF created from images? :: No built-in encryption feature. Ask about `safety and privacy`.

Can I add margins to the image itself, not the page? :: The 'Page Margins' in the Image to PDF tool add space around the image content *on the PDF page*. They don't modify the image file itself. If you need to add actual borders or padding *to the images*, you would need to do that using a separate image editing tool *before* using Image to PDF. Ask about `Set PDF page margins`.
Add border to image before PDF? :: You need a separate image editor for that; Image to PDF only controls page margins. Ask about `Set PDF page margins`.
Padding on the image itself? :: Not in Image to PDF; you need to modify the image file beforehand. Ask about `Set PDF page margins`.

What if the image has transparency? :: If you add a PNG or WEBP image with transparency to the Image to PDF tool, the transparent areas will typically be rendered on the PDF page with a white background by default, unless you use a different page background setting if available (which isn't a standard option in this tool based on my data). Transparency within the image file itself is not directly preserved in the PDF conversion in a way that would allow content *behind* the PDF page to show through. Ask about `What image formats can Image to PDF handle?`.
Transparency in source images for PDF :: Transparent areas in PNG/WEBP will likely appear white on the PDF page. Ask about `What image formats can Image to PDF handle?`.

What does the 'Balanced' preset do? :: In the PDF Compressor, the 'Balanced' preset is a compromise, often setting the page rendering DPI to around 120 DPI and using a reasonable image quality (e.g., 0.9 for JPEG). It offers a good balance between significant file size reduction and acceptable visual quality. This is often the default or recommended choice. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Explain Balanced preset :: It uses 120 DPI and medium-high image quality for a balance of size reduction and quality. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Balanced compression settings :: Sets DPI to ~120 and image quality moderate. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.

What does the 'Smaller Size' preset do? :: In the PDF Compressor, the 'Smaller Size' preset prioritizes file size reduction, typically setting the page rendering DPI to around 96 DPI and automatically enabling 'Convert Images to Grayscale'. It uses a lower image quality (e.g., 0.8 for JPEG). Expect noticeable quality loss, especially in images and text sharpness, but significant file size reduction. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Explain Smaller Size preset :: It uses 96 DPI, lower image quality, and converts to grayscale for maximum size reduction. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Smaller Size compression settings :: Sets DPI to ~96, lower image quality, enables grayscale. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.

What does the 'Extreme' preset do? :: In the PDF Compressor, the 'Extreme' preset aims for the absolute smallest file size possible, setting the page rendering DPI to around 72 DPI and automatically enabling 'Convert Images to Grayscale'. It uses the lowest image quality (e.g., 0.6 for JPEG). This will result in significant visual degradation, making it suitable only when the smallest file size is the only priority (e.g., for basic previews). Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Explain Extreme preset :: It uses 72 DPI, lowest image quality, and grayscale for the smallest possible size. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Extreme compression settings :: Sets DPI to ~72, lowest image quality, enables grayscale. Expect poor quality. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.

Manual DPI input? :: The advanced settings have a numerical input for DPI. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.

What is a good custom DPI for compression? :: A good custom DPI depends on your needs. 300 DPI is often considered print quality (minimal size reduction unless image quality is low). 150 DPI (Good Quality preset) is a good balance for readability and moderate reduction. 96 or 72 DPI (Smaller/Extreme presets) are for significant reduction but sacrifice sharpness. Experimentation is key. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Recommended custom DPI? :: Depends on goal. 150 for balance, 300 for quality, 72/96 for max reduction. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Best DPI setting for compressed PDF? :: There's no single "best" - it's a trade-off between size and quality. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.

Can I compress a PDF that contains only text? :: Yes, you can use the PDF Compressor on a text-only PDF. However, since this tool works by rasterizing pages to images, it will convert the crisp vector text into pixelated images. The size reduction might not be as significant as with image-heavy PDFs, and the text quality will decrease, especially at lower DPI settings. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Compress text-only PDF? :: Yes, but it will convert text to pixels and size reduction might vary. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Will compressing text-heavy PDF reduce size much? :: Maybe, but it flattens text to pixels, which can impact readability more than image reduction. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.

Does the PDF Compressor remove anything from the PDF besides quality? :: Yes, because the tool converts each page into a flat image, any complex elements beyond the visual appearance of the page are typically discarded. This includes interactive form fields, hyperlinks, bookmarks, layers, digital signatures, and potentially accessibility tags (OCR layers). Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Does compression remove links or bookmarks? :: Yes, elements like links, form fields, and bookmarks are generally lost as pages become flat images. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Interactive elements after compression? :: Interactive features like form fields or links are usually removed. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.

Can I protect the compressed PDF with a password? :: No, the PDF Compressor tool does not have options to add password protection, encryption, or usage restrictions (like preventing printing or copying) to the output file. You would need to use separate PDF security software for that after downloading the compressed PDF. Ask about `safety and privacy`.
Add password to compressed PDF? :: No, this tool doesn't add security features. Ask about `safety and privacy`.
Protect compressed PDF? :: No built-in protection features like passwords or restrictions. Ask about `safety and privacy`.

What is the 'Output Filename Suffix' for? :: In the PDF Compressor's advanced settings, the 'Output Filename Suffix' lets you add custom text to the end of the original filename before the ".pdf" extension (e.g., input "document.pdf", suffix "_small", output "document_small.pdf"). This is helpful for easily identifying compressed versions, especially in a batch. Ask about `PDF Compressor Output Filename Suffix option`.
Adding text to compressed file name? :: Use the 'Output Filename Suffix' field in advanced settings. Ask about `PDF Compressor Output Filename Suffix option`.
Rename output file after compression? :: You can add a suffix to the name using the advanced option. Ask about `PDF Compressor Output Filename Suffix option`.

Steps for using the chroma keyer :: Select tool, add image, pick key color, adjust sliders, choose PNG/WEBP output, process, download. Ask about `How to use Chroma Key tool`.

How to select the key color using Hex code? :: In the Chroma Key tool, you can directly type a hexadecimal color code (e.g., `#00FF00` for green, `#0000FF` for blue) into the 'Key Color Hex' input field. Press Enter or click away after typing to update the key color. Ask about `How to pick the color to remove`.
Set key color by hex value :: Type the hex code into the 'Key Color Hex' input field. Ask about `How to pick the color to remove`.
Hex code for color to remove :: Use the 'Key Color Hex' input field. Ask about `How to pick the color to remove`.

What is a good tolerance setting for green screen? :: A good 'Tolerance' setting in the Chroma Key tool depends on the specific green screen footage (lighting consistency, color variations). Start with a low value and gradually increase it while watching the preview until the green background is mostly transparent without making parts of your subject transparent. It requires some trial and error. Ask about `Adjusting transparency threshold in Chroma Key?`.
Recommended tolerance for green screen? :: Start low and increase gradually while checking the preview. Ask about `Adjusting transparency threshold in Chroma Key?`.
Best tolerance value? :: There's no single best value; it depends on the image. Adjust using the preview. Ask about `Adjusting transparency threshold in Chroma Key?`.

What is a good edge softness setting? :: A good 'Edge Softness' setting in the Chroma Key tool depends on the desired look. A value of 0 keeps edges sharp. Increasing the value feathers the transition, which can help blend the subject better onto a new background, especially if the original edges weren't perfectly clean. Too high a value can make the subject look blurry around the edges. Adjust while watching the preview. Ask about `Chroma Key edge softness`.
Recommended edge softness? :: Adjust while previewing. 0 for sharp, higher for feathered edges. Ask about `Chroma Key edge softness`.
Best edge softness value? :: Depends on the desired look; adjust with the slider and preview. Ask about `Chroma Key edge softness`.

Can I chroma key multiple different colors in one image? :: No, the Image Chroma Key tool only allows you to key out a *single* primary 'Key Color' and its variations based on the Tolerance setting. You cannot define multiple separate colors to remove simultaneously from the same image. If you need to remove multiple distinct colors, you would need to process the image multiple times, keying out a different color each time (though this can lead to issues with cumulative transparency). Ask about `How to pick the color to remove`.
Key out more than one color? :: No, the tool targets a single key color and its variations. Ask about `How to pick the color to remove`.
Remove multiple specific colors? :: Not simultaneously in one pass. Ask about `How to pick the color to remove`.

What happens if the color I want to remove is also in my subject? :: If the 'Key Color' you select is also present in the subject you want to keep, adjusting the 'Tolerance' and 'Edge Softness' will be critical but might not be perfect. Increasing tolerance to remove the background color will also make areas of the same color on your subject transparent. You might need to refine the key color selection using the eyedropper on a pure background area. Ask about `Adjusting transparency threshold in Chroma Key?`.
Color is in subject and background :: It's tricky. Adjust tolerance carefully or try to pick a key color from a 'purer' background area. Ask about `Adjusting transparency threshold in Chroma Key?`.
Chroma key removes parts of my subject :: This happens if the key color or its variations are present in your subject; try reducing tolerance. Ask about `Adjusting transparency threshold in Chroma Key?`.

How to ensure the background is fully transparent? :: To get a fully transparent background after chroma keying, you need two things: 1) Successfully key out the background color using the Key Color and Tolerance settings so it appears transparent in the preview, and 2) Select an 'Output Format' that supports transparency, specifically PNG or WEBP. JPEG will always result in a solid background. Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency`.
Background not transparent after chroma key? :: Ensure you selected PNG or WEBP output format. Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency`.
Why is my chroma key output still solid? :: You likely saved as JPEG, which doesn't support transparency. Use PNG or WEBP. Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency`.

What happens if I select an image format other than PNG or WEBP for output? :: If you select JPEG as the 'Output Format' in the Chroma Key tool, any transparency created by the chroma key process will be lost. The transparent areas will be filled with a solid color, usually white or black, when the JPEG image is saved. Other formats like BMP or GIF might not be directly supported as output depending on the specific tool configuration (based on the listed output formats). Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency`.
Output as JPEG from Chroma Key? :: Transparency will be lost. Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency`.
Save chroma keyed image as BMP/GIF? :: The Chroma Key tool lists PNG, JPEG, WEBP as output formats. Other formats might not be supported. Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency`.

Can I set different chroma key settings for different images in a batch? :: By default, the Chroma Key tool applies the *same* Key Color, Tolerance, Edge Softness, Invert Selection, and Output Format settings to *all* images you select for processing in a batch. You cannot configure individual settings per file within the batch. Ask about `Can I process multiple images with Chroma Key?`.

What is the minimum number of rows or columns? :: In the Image Splitter's Advanced Mode, the minimum value you can enter for both 'Rows' and 'Columns' is 1. Setting either to 1 will result in a split that is just one piece wide or tall (essentially no split in that direction). Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.
Minimum rows/columns for split? :: The minimum value is 1. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.
Can I set rows or columns to zero? :: No, the minimum value for rows and columns is 1. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.

What happens if I split into single pixels for a tiny image? :: Even for a small image (e.g., 10x10 pixels), splitting into single pixels will generate 100 tiny image files. While not as resource-intensive as a large image, it still creates many individual files. The warning about processing too many pieces is generally triggered based on total pixel count, not image size. Ask about `Image Splitter single pixel warning`.
Single pixel split on small image :: It still generates a separate file for every pixel. Ask about `Image Splitter single pixel warning`.
How many files from single pixel split? :: Width x Height of the image equals the number of output files. Ask about `Image Splitter single pixel warning`.

Can the Border/Spacing Color be set by Hex code? :: Yes, in the Image Splitter's 'Piece Styling & Output' section, you can set the 'Border/Spacing Color' using the color picker or by typing a hexadecimal color code into the input field next to the color picker. Ask about `Add border to split pieces`.

What happens if I use JPEG output for split pieces with transparent borders? :: If you set a 'Border/Spacing Width' and check the 'Transparent' checkbox for the color, but select JPEG as the 'Output Format', the transparency will be lost. JPEG does not support transparency, so the border areas will be filled with a solid color, usually white or black. Use PNG or WEBP output to preserve transparency. Ask about `Output format for split pieces`.
JPEG output with transparent borders? :: The transparency will not work; use PNG or WEBP. Ask about `Output format for split pieces`.
Transparent border issue with JPEG split output? :: JPEG doesn't support transparency. Choose PNG or WEBP. Ask about `Output format for split pieces`.

What placeholders are available for the Split Piece Filename Pattern? :: In the Image Splitter's 'Piece Styling & Output' options, the available placeholders for the 'Filename Pattern' are: `{name}` (base name of the input file), `{orig_ext}` (original file extension), `{row}` (row index, starting from 0), `{col}` (column index, starting from 0), `{index}` (the piece number in the grid, 0-based, counting left-to-right, top-to-bottom), and `{ext}` (the output file extension, e.g., .png). Ask about `Filename Pattern for Split Pieces`.
List filename pattern placeholders for splitter :: {name}, {orig_ext}, {row}, {col}, {index}, {ext} are available. Ask about `Filename Pattern for Split Pieces`.
How to name split pieces by row and column? :: Use the `{row}` and `{col}` placeholders in the 'Filename Pattern'. Ask about `Filename Pattern for Split Pieces`.
Include original filename in split piece names? :: Use the `{name}` placeholder. Ask about `Filename Pattern for Split Pieces`.

What determines the order of pieces when using the {index} placeholder? :: When using the `{index}` placeholder in the Image Splitter's filename pattern, the pieces are numbered sequentially starting from 0. The order is determined by reading the grid from left to right, row by row, starting from the top-left corner (row 0, column 0). Ask about `Filename Pattern for Split Pieces`.
How are pieces indexed? :: Pieces are indexed from 0, reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom across the grid. Ask about `Filename Pattern for Split Pieces`.
Index order in splitter output names? :: The `{index}` placeholder counts pieces from 0, going across rows then down. Ask about `Filename Pattern for Split Pieces`.

What happens if I add a ZIP file to Image Splitter? :: If you select a ZIP file using the 'Choose Image(s) or ZIP' button in the Image Splitter tool, the tool will automatically look inside the ZIP archive for supported image files. It will extract and add any found images to the list, ignoring any other file types within the ZIP. You can then select which of these images to split. Ask about `What image formats are compatible with the Collage tool?` (Note: Image Splitter uses similar input formats).
Using a zip archive of images for splitting :: The tool can extract supported image types from a ZIP file. Ask about `What image formats are compatible with the Collage tool?`.
Image Splitter from zip file :: Select the ZIP file containing your images using the 'Choose Image(s) or ZIP' button. Ask about `What image formats are compatible with the Collage tool?`.

Can I define piece size instead of grid size? :: No, the Image Splitter tool operates by defining the grid (number of rows and columns, or single pixels). The size of the resulting pieces is a *calculated* output based on the input image dimensions and your chosen grid. You cannot directly input desired pixel dimensions for the output pieces. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.
Set piece size for splitting? :: No, you define the grid (rows/cols), and the tool calculates piece size. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.
Input desired pixel size for output pieces? :: Not possible; you define the grid instead. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.

How to start over or clear the list in Image Splitter? :: To clear all the images currently in the list and reset the Image Splitter tool to its initial state, look for a 'Reset' or 'Clear All' button, usually located near the file list or main process button.

Can I apply both horizontal and vertical flip? :: Yes, in the Image Rotator & Flipper tool, you can click both the 'Flip H' and 'Flip V' buttons to apply both transformations simultaneously. Clicking either button again will toggle that specific flip off. Ask about `Flip image horizontally or vertically`.
Apply horizontal and vertical flip at same time? :: Yes, click both 'Flip H' and 'Flip V' buttons. Ask about `Flip image horizontally or vertically`.
Combine horizontal and vertical flip? :: Yes, both can be active together. Ask about `Flip image horizontally or vertically`.

What is the 'Reset' button for next to the angle? :: The 'Reset' button in the Image Rotator & Flipper tool immediately sets the 'Rotation Angle' input field back to 0 degrees and updates the preview to show the image without any rotation applied (only flips, if active). It's a quick way to clear the rotation setting. Ask about `Reset Rotation Angle`.
Reset rotation to zero? :: Click the 'Reset' button. Ask about `Reset Rotation Angle`.
Clear the rotation angle? :: Use the 'Reset' button. Ask about `Reset Rotation Angle`.

Explain the 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence' feature :: This is an advanced option in the Image Rotator & Flipper tool for batch processing. If enabled, instead of applying a single transformation to each selected image, it generates *multiple* output images *per input file*. These output images are created by rotating the original image through a sequence of angles defined by the 'Start Angle', 'End Angle', and 'Angle Step'. You can also apply a global horizontal/vertical flip to *every* image generated in this sequence. Ask about `Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence`.
What is the rotation sequence for batch? :: It's an advanced feature to generate multiple rotated versions of each image in a batch based on angle steps. Ask about `Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence`.
Generate sequence of rotated images? :: Use the 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence' feature. Ask about `Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence`.

How does the 'Start Angle', 'End Angle', and 'Angle Step' work together? :: In the 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence', the tool starts at the 'Start Angle'. It then generates images by adding the 'Angle Step' repeatedly until the angle passes the 'End Angle'. For example, Start=0, End=180, Step=90 generates images at 0°, 90°, 180°. Start=0, End=360, Step=30 generates images at 0°, 30°, 60°... up to 360°. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.
Explain Start, End, Step angles :: They define the range and increment for the rotation sequence. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.
How the sequence angles are calculated :: The tool starts at the Start Angle and adds the Step until it reaches/passes the End Angle. Ask about `Rotation Sequence Angle Settings`.

What does the 'Estimated images per input file' mean? :: This display in the 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence' estimates how many separate output image files the tool will generate for *each* original image file you select for processing. This number is calculated purely from your Start Angle, End Angle, and Angle Step settings. The total files in the final ZIP will be this estimate multiplied by the number of selected input files. Ask about `Estimated Images per Sequence File`.
Estimate of output files per image? :: That's what the 'Estimated images per input file' shows for the rotation sequence. Ask about `Estimated Images per Sequence File`.
How many files will the sequence create per image? :: Check the 'Estimated images per input file' display. Ask about `Estimated Images per Sequence File`.

Can I apply different rotation sequences to different images in a batch? :: No, the 'Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence' settings you configure (Start Angle, End Angle, Angle Step, and the flip options within the sequence) apply uniformly to *all* images you select for processing in the batch when the sequence is enabled. You cannot set individual sequence parameters per file within the batch. Ask about `Rotate and Flip Multiple Images`.
Different sequences for batch images? :: No, the advanced sequence settings apply to all selected files. Ask about `Rotate and Flip Multiple Images`.
Varied rotation sequences in batch? :: Not possible; the same sequence settings are used for all selected images. Ask about `Rotate and Flip Multiple Images`.

What happens if the output filename pattern creates duplicate names? :: The Image Rotator & Flipper tool, especially when using the Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence, appends transformation details (like angle) to the filename when you use the 'Rename file (basename)' option. This helps create unique names. If for some reason a duplicate name *were* generated (unlikely with the default naming), the tool would likely handle it internally to ensure unique outputs in the ZIP, but rely on the user to choose a pattern that prevents duplicates from transformation details. Ask about `Rotator Flipper Output Filename options`.
Duplicate output filenames? :: The tool adds transformation details to help prevent duplicates, especially with the sequence. Ask about `Rotator Flipper Output Filename options`.
Filename naming with rotation details :: The tool automatically appends rotation angle and flip indicators to the filename when you use the rename option. Ask about `Rotator Flipper Output Filename options`.

Can I rotate and then flip, or flip and then rotate? Does it matter? :: In the Image Rotator & Flipper tool, the order in which you click the buttons or set the values doesn't matter for the *final result*. The tool calculates the final transformation based on the cumulative effect of the angle and flips applied. Applying a rotation and then a flip will yield the same final image as applying the flip and then the rotation (though mathematically the order of matrix transformations *can* matter, the tool handles this complexity for you). Ask about `How to rotate an image` and `Flip image horizontally or vertically`.
Order of rotate and flip :: The order doesn't affect the final outcome in this tool. Ask about `How to rotate an image`.
Rotate then flip vs flip then rotate :: The result is the same. Ask about `How to rotate an image`.

What happens if I add a ZIP file to Image Rotate & Flip? :: If you select a ZIP file using the 'Choose Image(s)' button in the Image Rotator & Flipper tool, the tool will automatically look inside the ZIP archive for supported image files. It will extract and add any found images to the list, ignoring any other file types within the ZIP. You can then select which of these images to transform. Ask about `What image formats can Image Converter read?` (Note: Rotate & Flip uses similar input formats).
Using a zip archive of images for rotate/flip :: The tool can extract supported image types from a ZIP file. Ask about `What image formats can Image Converter read?`.
Rotate/Flip images from zip file :: Select the ZIP file containing your images using the 'Choose Image(s)' button. Ask about `What image formats can Image Converter read?`.

Batch selection in the list :: Check the boxes next to the files you want to include in the batch. Ask about `Select Files in List`.

How to view the original image from the file list? :: In tools that show a file list and preview, each image item typically has an eye icon button. Click this icon to open a fullscreen preview of the *original* image file as it was loaded, before any tool-specific processing or transformations are applied. Ask `View Original Image in Collage Tool` (this feature is common across tools with previews).
See the original file before processing :: Click the eye icon next to the file name in the list. Ask `View Original Image in Collage Tool`.
Preview original image from list :: Use the eye icon next to the list item. Ask `View Original Image in Collage Tool`.

What do the eye icons in the file list do? :: The eye icons next to items in the file list allow you to view a fullscreen preview of the *original* image or PDF page represented by that list item, before any tool settings are applied. Ask `View Original Image in Collage Tool`.
Eye icon function in file list :: It opens a preview of the original file content. Ask `View Original Image in Collage Tool`.

How does the fullscreen preview work? :: In tools with a preview area, clicking the fullscreen button (usually near the top-right of the preview) opens the *currently displayed* preview image in a larger modal window that fills your screen. This lets you examine the potential output or original in more detail. Close the modal (usually by clicking outside it or pressing Esc) to return. Ask `Fullscreen Preview`.
How to close fullscreen preview :: Click outside the large preview window or press the Escape key. Ask `Fullscreen Preview`.
Exit fullscreen preview :: Click outside the preview modal or press Esc. Ask `Fullscreen Preview`.

What is the difference between 'Process & Download (ZIP)' and 'Download Single File'? :: 'Process & Download (ZIP)' is typically used for batch processing multiple selected files or when a single output operation generates multiple files (like Image Splitter or Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence). It packages all results into one ZIP. 'Download Single File' is available *only* when you have processed *one* file and the output is a single file, allowing you to download it directly without a ZIP wrapper. Ask about `Download Output`.
ZIP download vs single download :: ZIP is for batches or multiple outputs, single download is for one output file. Ask about `Download Output`.
When do I get a ZIP file? :: Usually when processing a batch of files or when one input file generates multiple output files (like Image Splitter or Rotate Sequence). Ask about `Download Output`.
When do I get a single file download? :: Only when processing one input file that generates exactly one output file. Ask about `Download Output`.

Can I process a mix of image and PDF files together in one tool? :: No, each tool is designed to work specifically with either image files (Image Converter, Collage, Chroma Key, Splitter, Rotate & Flip) or PDF files (PDF Compressor, PDF to Image), or images *into* a PDF (Image to PDF). You cannot load a mix of image and PDF files into the same tool at the same time. Ask about `list all tools`.
Mix image and PDF inputs? :: No, each tool handles either images or PDFs, but not both together. Ask about `list all tools`.
Process image and PDF batch together? :: Not possible; use separate tools for images and PDFs. Ask about `list all tools`.

What happens if I drag and drop files onto the tool area? :: The user interface *might* support drag-and-drop as an alternative way to select files, behaving the same as clicking the 'Choose File(s)' button. However, this is implementation-dependent and not explicitly stated in the data. If it works, it acts like clicking the button. If not, the user should be instructed to use the button. Assume it might work but the button is the guaranteed method.
Drag and drop files? :: You can usually drag and drop files onto the designated area or button as an alternative to clicking 'Choose File(s)'. This functions the same as using the button. Ask about `how to select files`.
Can I drag files here? :: Yes, dragging files onto the tool's input area often works the same as clicking the 'Choose File(s)' button. Ask about `how to select files`.

What browser privacy settings might affect the tools? :: Since processing is client-side, privacy settings are usually not an issue. However, very strict browser security settings, privacy extensions, or ad blockers *could* potentially interfere with the download of the output file (especially ZIPs) or the functioning of certain interactive elements like the eyedropper tool if they misinterpret the tool's local actions as malicious. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips` or `Using the eyedropper in Chroma Key`.
Browser privacy affects tools? :: Generally no, as processing is local, but very strict settings or extensions might affect downloads. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.
Ad blockers interference? :: Rarely, but sometimes ad blockers might block the download action. Try temporarily disabling it if downloads fail. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.

Why did the processing time increase when I changed settings? :: Some settings make the processing task more complex or resource-intensive. For example:
*   Higher DPI or Max Dimension in PDF to Image (more pixels to render).
*   Lower quality for JPEG/WEBP (more complex compression calculations sometimes).
*   Splitting into a very large number of pieces (many small images to create and save).
*   Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence with many steps (many output images to generate).
Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Processing took longer after changing options :: Some settings increase the complexity or output size, requiring more processing time. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Why is it slower with different settings? :: Settings like higher resolution, more pieces, or complex sequences increase the workload. Ask about `Progress Bar`.

Can I save my settings for later? :: No, the tools are designed for single-use sessions within the browser tab. Your selected files and settings are typically reset when you close the tool or the browser tab. There is no feature to save or load settings profiles for future use. Ask about `offline capability`.
Save settings? :: No, settings are not saved when you close the tool or browser tab. Ask about `offline capability`.
Remember my settings? :: The tool does not remember settings between sessions. Ask about `offline capability`.

Can I use keyboard shortcuts? :: Specific keyboard shortcuts for navigating the tool or triggering actions (like starting processing) are not a standard feature and are not documented in the data. Basic browser shortcuts (like using Tab to navigate fields) may work. Ask about `how do I use this`.
Keyboard shortcuts for tool? :: No specific shortcuts are built into the tools or documented. Ask about `how do I use this`.

Is there a progress bar for file loading? :: Yes, some tools might display a progress indicator specifically for the initial phase of loading large files into the browser's memory before processing begins. This is similar to the main processing progress bar. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
File loading progress :: A progress bar might appear while large files are loading initially. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Loading bar explanation :: It shows the progress of reading the file into the tool's memory. Ask about `Progress Bar`.

# --- Troubleshooting - More Specifics ---
Error message "Out of memory" or "DOMException 12" :: This specific error (or similar messages in the browser console) strongly indicates that your browser ran out of memory while trying to load or process files. This usually happens with very large files, high resolutions, or large batches. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
DOMException 12 error :: This often means the browser ran out of memory. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
Memory error during processing :: This happens when the browser's memory limit is reached. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.

Process fails without an obvious error message :: If processing stops, the progress bar disappears, and the download button doesn't become active, but no specific error message is shown in the tool's progress area, check your browser's developer console (usually accessed by pressing the F12 key and looking at the 'Console' tab). Browser-level errors might be logged there. Memory issues are a common cause for silent failures. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
Silent processing failure :: Check the browser's developer console (F12) for errors. Memory issues are common. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
Process stops but no error shown :: Look in the browser's developer console (F12) for possible error messages. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.

Downloaded ZIP file is empty or corrupted :: If you downloaded a ZIP after batch processing but it's empty, or your operating system reports it as corrupted, it likely means that the processing itself failed for all files, or the zipping process encountered an error. Check the progress text for errors during the processing phase. Try processing a smaller batch. Ask about `Batch download failed`.
Empty zip after download :: This indicates processing likely failed for all files in the batch. Check for errors during processing. Ask about `Batch download failed`.
Downloaded zip is corrupted :: The zipping process might have failed, or processing failed. Check for errors during processing. Ask about `Batch download failed`.

Output image quality is lower than expected :: If the quality of the output image (from Image Converter, Chroma Key, PDF to Image, Collage, Splitter, Rotate/Flip) is worse than expected, check the quality settings you selected. For formats like JPEG or WEBP, ensure the quality slider is set high enough. For PDF to Image or PDF Compressor, lower DPI settings significantly reduce quality. For Collage/Splitter, check output format/quality settings. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options` or `PDF to Image Quality options`.
Output quality is bad :: Check the quality settings (sliders, DPI presets) in the tool you used. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options`.
Image looks pixelated after processing :: This can happen with lower quality/compression settings or lower DPI in PDF tools. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options`.

Text in the output PDF looks blurry or pixelated :: In the PDF Compressor tool, text is converted to pixels (rasterized) along with images. Lower 'Page Render DPI' settings result in lower resolution page images, making text look less sharp or pixelated, especially when zoomed in. To keep text sharper, use a higher DPI preset (like Good Quality) or set a custom higher DPI. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Text blurry in compressed PDF :: This is due to low DPI settings during rasterization. Use higher DPI. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
Text pixelated in compressed PDF :: Lower DPI flattens crisp text into pixels. Use higher DPI for sharper text. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.

Transparent background/borders are not working :: If you expected transparency in the output (from Chroma Key, Collage, Splitter) but the transparent areas are filled with a solid color, ensure you selected an output format that *supports* transparency (PNG or WEBP) and that the specific transparency option was enabled in the tool's settings (e.g., 'Transparent' background/border checkbox). JPEG format does not support transparency. Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency` or `Collage Background Color option`.
Transparency is not preserved :: Ensure you are using PNG or WEBP output format and the transparency option is enabled. Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency`.
Transparent background turns solid :: You likely saved as JPEG, or didn't enable transparency for PNG/WEBP. Ask about `Chroma Key output with transparency`.

Output file size is larger than the input file :: This can sometimes happen, particularly with Image Converter or Chroma Key, if the original file used a highly efficient compression or a proprietary format, and you are converting it to a less efficient format or using a very high quality setting (minimal compression). For example, converting a highly compressed JPG or a HEIC to a lossless PNG or a very high quality JPEG could result in a larger file. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options`.
Output file is bigger than original :: This can happen if the original was highly compressed or in an efficient format, and you converted to a less efficient format or used very high quality settings. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options`.
File size increased after conversion :: Converting to a lossless format or using max quality can result in a larger size if the source was heavily compressed. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options`.

# --- More General Troubleshooting ---
Downloaded file appears different than the preview :: If the downloaded file doesn't match the preview, first ensure you downloaded the correct file/ZIP and that it opened correctly in your software. Minor rendering differences can sometimes occur between the in-browser preview and external software, especially for PDFs. If the difference is significant, there might have been an error during the final processing/download phase. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips` or `Processing error occurred`.
Downloaded file doesn't match preview :: Check that processing completed without errors and you downloaded the correct file. Minor differences are possible. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.
Output looks wrong after download :: Verify processing completed correctly and the download succeeded. Rendering differences can occur. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.

The preview is slow to update :: Preview generation requires processing the image or PDF page with the current settings. Complex images, high resolutions, or certain settings (like high DPI in PDF tools, applying filters if they existed - Note: they don't based on data, so focus on current settings) can make preview generation take longer. Using a faster device or a simpler source file might help. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Preview update is slow :: Complex source files or certain tool settings can make generating the preview take longer. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Preview takes a long time to load :: This is often due to processing the image/page for preview; complexity increases time. Ask about `Progress Bar`.

Browser console showing errors (F12) :: If you open your browser's developer console (usually F12) and see many red error messages while using the tool, it indicates a technical issue within the tool's execution. Common reasons are memory limits being hit (often visible as "Out of memory" or DOMException), or potentially a bug related to specific file characteristics or browser versions. If you see errors here, try simplifying the task or using a different file. Ask about `Memory issues during processing` or `Troubleshooting steps for errors`.
Errors in browser console :: This indicates an internal technical problem. Try simplifying the task or restarting. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
F12 console shows errors :: Developer console errors mean something went wrong internally. Ask about `Troubleshooting steps for errors`.

Tool seems frozen or unresponsive :: If the tool stops responding to clicks or input, especially during or after adding files or processing, it might be overwhelmed by the task (e.g., too many large files, very complex operation) and is using all available browser resources (CPU/Memory). Try waiting, or if necessary, close and reopen the browser tab. For recurring issues with large tasks, try processing smaller batches. Ask about `Memory issues during processing` or `Cancel Processing`.
Tool is not responding :: This can happen if the task is too large or complex for your browser's resources. Try closing and restarting. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
Tool froze :: If the tool is unresponsive, it might be due to a resource-intensive task. Close and reopen. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.

Input file size limit? :: There's no fixed file size limit hardcoded into the tools. The practical limit is determined by your browser's ability to load the file into memory and your device's processing power and available RAM. Very large files might fail to load or cause processing to be extremely slow or crash. Ask about `Memory issues during processing` and `Tips for processing large files`.
Maximum file size for input? :: Limited by your device's memory and browser, not a specific tool limit. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
Can I process very large files? :: Yes, up to your browser's and device's limits. Large files can cause slowdowns or errors. Ask about `Tips for processing large files`.

Output file size limit? :: Similarly, there's no fixed limit on the output file size. However, downloading extremely large files generated by the tools (especially very large ZIPs with many items) can sometimes be limited by browser or operating system capabilities, or network issues. Ensure you have sufficient disk space. Ask about `Large file download issue`.
Maximum size of output file? :: Limited by your device's storage and browser's download handling, not the tool itself. Ask about `Large file download issue`.
Can the tool create very large output files? :: Yes, especially with large inputs or settings that increase size (e.g., high quality, many outputs in sequence/split). Downloading them might require sufficient resources. Ask about `Large file download issue`.

# --- Conversational Fillers - Expanding ---
wow this is fast :: Wow, glad to hear it's fast for you! The client-side processing helps make things quick since files stay local. What task did you just complete quickly? Ask about `where are my files processed`.
amazing speed :: Amazing! The speed is a key benefit of processing files directly in your browser. What's next on your file task list? Ask `list all tools`.
cool it was quick :: Cool, I'm happy it was quick! What file manipulation are you planning to do now? Ask `list all tools`.
neat the process was quick :: Neat! The quick processing is thanks to your browser and device doing the work. How else can I help you with file tasks? Ask `what can you do`.

tell me more about the processing :: I can tell you more about how the processing works! It all happens locally within your web browser using JavaScript and WebAssembly technologies. Your files are loaded into temporary memory and transformed there, never being sent to a server. This makes it private and often quite fast, depending on your device. Ask about `where are my files processed`.
Go on about processing :: The file processing occurs entirely client-side. Your browser's resources (CPU, RAM) are used to perform the transformations directly on your device. The tool script directs these operations based on your selected settings. Ask about `where are my files processed`.
Continue explaining processing :: Processing involves reading your file into memory, applying the mathematical operations defined by the tool's settings (like scaling, rotation, color analysis, rasterization), and then generating the new file data, which is then offered for download. Ask about `where are my files processed`.

I don't understand how it works offline :: That's a great question! This isn't a typical website that sends your data to a server. Instead, when you open this page, all the necessary code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for the tools and for me is loaded into your browser. The processing logic runs *within* that code in your browser's environment. Your files are selected by you and accessed by this local code, processed in your browser's memory, and then the output is created also in your browser and offered back to you. No internet connection is needed for the processing itself once the page is loaded. Ask about `offline capability`.
Confused about offline processing :: The tools use modern web technologies to perform file manipulations directly in your browser's environment, not on a remote server. This means the heavy lifting happens on your computer after the page loads. Ask about `offline capability`.
How does offline work? :: All the intelligence for the tools and the processing happens in the code loaded into your browser. Your files are processed by that code on your device. Ask about `offline capability`.

You seem helpful :: I'm very glad to hear that! Being helpful is my purpose. What specific task or feature can I guide you through next? Ask `how do I use this`.
You help me understand :: That's fantastic! Making the tools understandable is my goal. What concept or step should we clarify next? Ask `how do I use this`.

# --- Even More Troubleshooting Details ---
Why might the preview not update? :: If the preview in a tool isn't updating after you change settings or select a different image from the list, first make sure you clicked the required 'Update Preview' button if the tool has one (like Image Collage, Image Splitter). If there's no update button or clicking it doesn't work, check if the process is stuck or if there are error messages displayed or in the browser console (F12). Ask about `Update Collage Preview button` or `Processing is stuck`.
Preview not refreshing :: Ensure you clicked 'Update Preview' if the tool requires it. If still stuck, check for errors or a frozen process. Ask about `Processing is stuck`.
Preview frozen :: This might mean the process is stuck or there's an error preventing the preview from rendering. Check for errors or try cancelling and restarting. Ask about `Processing is stuck`.

Error message about file type :: If you get an error immediately after selecting a file that mentions file type or format, it means the file you selected is not supported by the tool you are currently using. Double-check the supported input formats for that tool and ensure your file matches one of them. Ask about `Supported image types for PDF creation?` or `What image formats can Image Converter read?` (Tailor to the specific tool).
Wrong file type error :: The file format you selected is not supported by the tool. Check the list of supported formats. Ask about `Supported image types for PDF creation?`.
File format not supported :: You've tried to load a file type that this tool cannot process. Ask about `Supported image types for PDF creation?`.

Error message about file corruption :: If an error message mentions file corruption or inability to read the file, the input file itself might be damaged or saved incorrectly. Try opening the file in standard software (like a photo viewer or PDF reader) to see if it opens correctly. If it doesn't, you may need to obtain an uncorrupted copy. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
File is corrupted error :: The input file is likely damaged and cannot be read by the tool. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Cannot read input file :: This could mean the file is corrupted or in an unsupported variation. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

Process finishes instantly but no output/error :: If you click process and it seems to finish immediately with the progress bar flashing to 100% but no download occurs and no error is visible, it's possible zero valid files were selected for processing, or the settings resulted in zero output (e.g., invalid page range in PDF to Image). Check the file list to ensure files are selected (checkboxes) and your settings are valid. Ask about `Select Files in List` or `How to select pages from PDF`.
Process finished instantly but no download :: Ensure files were selected in the list and settings (like page range) are valid. Ask about `Select Files in List`.
Process showed 100% immediately with no result :: Check file selection checkboxes and tool-specific settings like page range. Ask about `Select Files in List`.

Cannot download single file, only ZIP :: In some tools (like Rotate & Flip, Chroma Key, Converter), the 'Download Single File' button appears *only* when you have selected *exactly one* file for processing AND (for Rotate & Flip) the advanced sequence is NOT enabled. If you have multiple files selected or the sequence is on, only the 'Process & Download (ZIP)' button will be available. Ask about `Download Single Converted File` or `Download Single Processed Image Chroma Key` or `Download Single Processed Image Rotator Flipper`.
No single file download option :: This means you have multiple files selected, or (in Rotate & Flip) the advanced sequence is enabled. The output will be a ZIP. Ask about `Download Single Converted File`.
Only zip download available :: If you processed more than one file, or used a feature generating multiple outputs per file, the result is always a ZIP. Ask about `Download Output`.

How to find the downloaded file? :: When you click a download button, your web browser typically saves the file(s) to your computer's default download location. This is usually a folder named "Downloads" within your user profile. You can check your browser's download history (often Ctrl+J or Cmd+J) to see the file name and location. Ask about `Download Output`.
Where did my file download to? :: Check your browser's default download folder or its download history (Ctrl+J or Cmd+J). Ask about `Download Output`.
Locate downloaded output file :: Look in your browser's download history or your default downloads folder. Ask about `Download Output`.

My computer seems very slow while processing :: File processing requires your computer's CPU and memory (RAM). Processing large files, high-resolution images, or extensive batches in your browser can consume significant resources, potentially slowing down your entire system. This is normal for resource-intensive tasks. Try closing other applications and browser tabs, or process in smaller batches. Ask about `Tips for processing large files` or `Memory issues during processing`.
Computer slowed down during processing :: Processing files locally uses your system resources. Try simplifying the task or closing other apps. Ask about `Tips for processing large files`.
High CPU usage from tool :: Local processing is CPU intensive. This is expected for complex tasks or large files. Ask about `Tips for processing large files`.
Why is my system lagging? :: File processing in the browser can be resource-heavy. Ask about `Tips for processing large files`.

# --- Asking about specific settings that don't exist (Refuse/Redirect) ---
Can I set a specific resolution (in pixels) for the output images in Image Converter? :: I'm sorry, the Image Converter tool does not have a feature to set a specific output resolution or resize images by pixel dimensions. It primarily converts the format while keeping the original pixel dimensions. If you need to resize, you would need to use separate image editing software. Ask about `What does the Image Converter tool do?`.
Set output pixel size for converted image? :: No, the Image Converter does not resize; it keeps original dimensions. Ask about `What does the Image Converter tool do?`.
Resize by pixels in Image Converter? :: Not possible; use a separate resizing tool. Ask about `What does the Image Converter tool do?`.

Can I set a target file size for compression? :: No, the PDF Compressor tool does not allow you to set a specific target file size. You choose a compression preset (which uses predefined DPI/Quality settings) or manually adjust DPI/Quality, and the tool performs the compression based on those settings. The resulting file size will vary depending on the original PDF content and your chosen options. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Target file size for PDF compressor? :: Not an available option. You set quality/DPI instead. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Set max file size for compressed PDF? :: No, you control compression via presets or DPI/Quality sliders, not a target size. Ask about `PDF Compression Preset options`.

Can I specify the number of output files I want from the Image Splitter? :: Yes, indirectly. In Simple Mode, choosing a template like 2x2 means you'll get 4 files. In Advanced Mode, setting R rows and C columns means you'll get R * C files. If splitting into single pixels, you get Width * Height files. So you control the *number* of pieces by defining the grid or pixel mode. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split` or `Split Image into Single Pixels`.
Set the number of output files from splitter? :: Yes, by choosing the grid (Rows x Columns) or single pixel mode. Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.
How many files will Image Splitter create? :: That depends on your Rows and Columns settings (Rows * Columns) or the image dimensions if splitting into single pixels (Width * Height). Ask about `Set custom Rows and Columns for split`.

Can I set the DPI for output images in Chroma Key? :: The Chroma Key tool focuses on removing color and outputting in standard image formats (PNG/JPEG/WEBP). These formats don't inherently have a "DPI" embedded in the same way PDFs do. The output image will have the same pixel dimensions as the input image, and its effective "DPI" would only be relevant when printing, depending on the print size. The tool does not have a setting to control output DPI. Ask about `Chroma Key tool guide`.
Set output DPI for chroma keyed image? :: No, the tool outputs images at the original pixel dimensions. DPI is not a setting here. Ask about `Chroma Key tool guide`.
Control resolution of chroma key output? :: The output image has the same pixel dimensions as the input. Resolution for printing depends on print size. Ask about `Chroma Key tool guide`.

Can I add a border *inside* the image in the Rotate & Flip tool? :: No, the Image Rotate & Flip tool only performs transformations (rotation and mirroring) on the existing image content. It does not have any image editing features like adding borders or modifying pixels inside the image. You would need to do that using a separate image editing tool beforehand. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.
Add border to image in Rotate & Flip? :: No, this tool only transforms the existing image. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.

Can I rotate a specific area of the image? :: No, the Image Rotate & Flip tool applies the rotation and flip transformations to the *entire* image canvas. It does not support selecting and transforming only a specific region or layer within the image. You would need to use separate image editing software for that. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.
Rotate part of an image? :: No, the transformation applies to the whole image. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.
Rotate selected area? :: Not possible with this tool. Ask about `Image Rotate & Flip tool guide`.

Can I apply different transformations to different images in the standard Rotate & Flip batch? :: No, the standard batch processing in the Image Rotate & Flip tool applies the *same* selected rotation angle and flip settings to *all* images you check in the list. If you need different transformations for each image, you must process them individually (unless using the advanced sequence to generate *multiple* outputs per file with varying rotations). Ask about `Rotate and Flip Multiple Images`.
Different rotate/flip settings for batch? :: No, the same transformation applies to all selected files in a standard batch. Ask about `Rotate and Flip Multiple Images`.
Apply unique rotation per image in batch? :: Not in the standard batch; you must process individually or use the sequence for variations. Ask about `Rotate and Flip Multiple Images`.

# --- Even More Conversational / Alive ---

Add more files after a batch is done :: Yes, just click the 'Choose File(s)' button again.

# --- Batch Processing - More Details ---
Explain batch processing :: Batch processing allows you to load multiple files into a tool and apply the same operation and settings to all of them in one go. After selecting files, they appear in a list where you control which ones are included. The result is typically a single ZIP file containing the processed output for each selected input file. Ask about `Batch Processing`.
How batch processing works :: You select multiple files, configure settings that apply to the whole batch, and the tool processes them sequentially or in parallel in your browser, packaging results into a ZIP. Ask about `Batch Processing`.
Benefit of batch processing :: Saves time by allowing you to apply the same task to many files without doing them one by one. Ask about `Batch Processing`.

How to select files for batch processing? :: After loading multiple files, use the checkboxes next to each file name in the file list to select which ones you want to include in the batch process. The main 'Process' or 'Download' button will only operate on the files that are checked. Ask about `Select Files in List`.
Picking files for a batch run :: Use the checkboxes in the file list after adding files. Ask about `Select Files in List`.
How to include files in a batch? :: Check the box next to their name in the file list. Ask about `Select Files in List`.
How to exclude files from a batch? :: Uncheck the box next to their name in the file list. Ask about `Select Files in List`.

What is the 'Select All' button for? :: The 'Select All' button in the file list section is a quick way to check the checkbox for *every* file currently loaded in the list, marking them all for inclusion in the next batch process. Ask about `Select All Files`.
How to check all boxes in the file list? :: Click the 'Select All' button. Ask about `Select All Files`.

What is the 'Deselect All' button for? :: The 'Deselect All' button in the file list section is a quick way to uncheck the checkbox for *every* file currently loaded in the list, removing all files from the processing selection. This is useful for clearing the selection to pick only a few files. Ask about `Deselect All Files`.
How to uncheck all boxes in the file list? :: Click the 'Deselect All' button. Ask about `Deselect All Files`.

What happens if I don't select any files in the list? :: If you have files loaded but none of the checkboxes in the list are checked, the batch process (when you click the main button) will typically run but process zero files, resulting in an empty or minimal output (like an empty ZIP file). You must select at least one file. Ask about `Select Files in List`.
Processing with no files selected? :: The tool will attempt to process but will skip all files, resulting in no output. Ask about `Select Files in List`.

What happens if I click the process button before selecting files? :: If you click a main 'Process' or 'Download' button when no files have been loaded into the tool yet, nothing will happen, or the button might be disabled/greyed out. You must load files first using the 'Choose File(s)' button. Ask about `how to select files`.
Clicking process button with empty list? :: Nothing will happen. You need to add files first. Ask about `how to select files`.

# --- Progress & Cancellation - More Details ---
What does the text below the progress bar mean? :: The text displayed below the progress bar provides updates on the current step of the processing task (e.g., "Loading file...", "Processing page...", "Compressing image...", "Zipping results"). It helps you understand what the tool is currently doing. It may also display error messages if something goes wrong. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Progress text explanation :: It tells you the current step the tool is performing. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Why does the progress text change? :: It reflects the different stages of the processing operation. Ask about `Progress Bar`.

Why is the progress bar stuck? :: If the progress bar is not moving for a significant time, the processing might have encountered an issue or could be taking an extremely long time for a very large or complex task. Check the text below the progress bar for error messages. If none appear, the browser might be struggling with the load (memory issue). Ask about `Processing is stuck` or `Memory issues during processing`.
Progress bar not moving :: The process might be stuck due to an error or memory issue. Check for messages. Ask about `Processing is stuck`.

How to cancel a process that's taking too long? :: If a process is taking an excessive amount of time, look for a 'Cancel' button, usually located near the progress bar. Clicking it will signal the tool to stop the current operation. It might take a moment to halt completely. Ask about `Cancel Processing`.
Stop processing because it's too slow :: Click the 'Cancel' button. Ask about `Cancel Processing`.
Abandoning a long-running task :: Use the 'Cancel' button. Ask about `Cancel Processing`.

What happens when I click 'Cancel'? :: Clicking the 'Cancel' button attempts to stop the current file processing task. The tool will try to halt the operation gracefully. No output file will be generated for the cancelled process, even if it was partially complete. Ask about `Cancel Processing`.
Function of the cancel button :: It stops the currently running processing task. Ask about `Cancel Processing`.
Does cancelling save the progress? :: No, cancelling stops the process, and no output is generated. Ask about `Cancel Processing`.

# --- Preview Features - More Details ---
What is the fullscreen preview button? :: The fullscreen preview button (often an expanding arrow icon) is available in tools with a visual preview area. Clicking it opens the currently displayed preview image in a large window covering most of your screen, allowing you to inspect details more easily. Ask about `Fullscreen Preview`.
Icon for fullscreen preview? :: Look for an icon with arrows pointing outwards, usually near the preview area. Ask about `Fullscreen Preview`.

Why is the preview not available in some tools? :: Tools that don't have a direct visual output to preview during configuration (like PDF Compressor) typically don't have a preview area. The preview is useful for tools like Image Converter, Chroma Key, Image Splitter, PDF to Image where you can see the result of settings on an image or page before processing. Ask about `Fullscreen Preview`.
No preview shown for this tool :: Some tools, like PDF Compressor, don't generate a visual output during the settings phase and thus don't have a preview feature. Ask about `Fullscreen Preview`.

Can I zoom in on the preview? :: The standard fullscreen preview provided by the tool typically displays the preview image at its maximum size fitting the screen but does not offer interactive zoom controls within the modal window itself. For closer inspection, you might need to download the output and view it in separate image software. Ask about `Fullscreen Preview`.
Zoom on the preview? :: The built-in preview doesn't have zoom controls. Ask about `Fullscreen Preview`.
How to zoom in on the image preview? :: The fullscreen preview shows a larger view but doesn't support zooming within the tool. Ask about `Fullscreen Preview`.

# --- Output & Download - More Details ---
Where does the downloaded file go? :: By default, your web browser will save any downloaded files into the designated "Downloads" folder on your computer (or device). You can usually find this location in your browser's settings or preferences. Ask about `Download Output`.
Default download location :: Check your browser's settings; typically, it's a 'Downloads' folder. Ask about `Download Output`.
How to find the file after I download it? :: Look in your computer's default download folder. Ask about `Download Output`.

What is a ZIP file? :: A ZIP file is a single file that contains one or more compressed files or folders. Tools often package multiple output files (like in batch processing, Image Splitter, or Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence) into a ZIP archive for easier downloading and organization. You'll need to "extract" or "unzip" the contents to access the individual files inside. Ask about `Download Output`.
What is a .zip file? :: A single file containing other files, often used for bundling multiple downloads. Ask about `Download Output`.
How to open a ZIP file? :: Most operating systems have built-in support to open (extract) ZIP files by double-clicking them. Ask about `Download Output`.

Why did I get a ZIP file instead of a single image/PDF? :: You received a ZIP file because the process generated multiple output files (e.g., processing a batch of images, splitting an image into many pieces, or generating a sequence of rotated images). A ZIP bundles these multiple files together for a single download. Ask about `Download Output`.
Got a zip, expected one file :: This means the process created more than one output file, so they were bundled in a ZIP. Ask about `Download Output`.
Why is the output a zip? :: The tool created multiple files (batch, split, or sequence output), which are packaged in a ZIP. Ask about `Download Output`.

Can I choose the output filename? :: Some tools allow you to set a custom base name or add a suffix to the output filename, usually found in 'Advanced Options' or output settings. This helps in identifying the downloaded files, especially in batch outputs where sequential numbering or transformation details are often appended. Ask about `Rename Output Files`.
Customize the name of the saved file? :: Check the tool's options for a 'Rename' or 'Filename Pattern' setting. Ask about `Rename Output Files`.
Set the filename before downloading? :: You can often set a base name or suffix for the output files via tool settings. Ask about `Rename Output Files`.

# --- Troubleshooting - Deeper Dives ---
What does an "invalid file" error mean? :: An "invalid file" error means the tool was unable to read or process the file you selected. This is most commonly because the file is either corrupted (damaged) or its format is not actually supported by the specific tool you are trying to use, even if it looks like a compatible file extension. Password-protected PDFs will also cause this error in PDF tools. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Error loading invalid file :: The file is likely corrupted or in an unsupported format for the tool. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Tool says file is invalid :: The file is damaged or the wrong type. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

What should I do if I get a memory error? :: If the tool shows a message about "Out of memory" or the browser becomes unresponsive and crashes, it means the task required more RAM than your browser or device could provide. To resolve this:
1.  Close other browser tabs and applications to free up memory.
2.  If processing a batch, try selecting a much smaller number of files.
3.  If using settings that increase file size (like high DPI/quality, splitting into many pieces), try using lower settings.
4.  If processing one very large file, your device might not have enough memory.
Ask about `Memory issues during processing` and `Tips for processing large files`.
How to fix out of memory error :: Free up RAM by closing other things, process smaller batches, or use lower quality settings. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
Browser crashing during processing :: This is often a sign of memory issues. Try processing smaller files or batches. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.

Why is processing slow even for small files? :: While processing is client-side, performance still depends on your device's speed (CPU). Complex operations (even on small files) or running many other demanding tasks on your computer simultaneously can slow down the process. Ensure other applications aren't heavily using your CPU or memory. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Processing slow for small files? :: Could be a complex operation or your computer is busy with other tasks. Ask about `Progress Bar`.
Computer performance affects tool speed? :: Yes, since processing happens on your device, its CPU and RAM directly impact speed. Ask about `Progress Bar`.

What causes processing errors other than invalid files or memory? :: Less common causes can include temporary glitches in the browser's JavaScript engine, issues specific to a particular file's internal structure (even if not fully corrupted), or very rarely, a bug in the tool's code triggered by a specific combination of settings or input file type variation. If errors persist with different files and settings, ensuring your browser is updated is a good step. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Other reasons for processing failure? :: Browser glitches, unusual file structures, or rare bugs. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Why did processing fail if memory is okay and file is fine? :: Could be a browser issue or a rare file-specific problem. Try updating your browser. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

Why might a downloaded file open incorrectly in other software? :: If the downloaded file (image or PDF) doesn't open or display correctly in your standard software, it could potentially indicate an issue during the tool's processing or the download itself (corruption). Ensure processing finished without errors, try downloading again, and try opening it in different software if possible. Minor rendering differences are sometimes expected between different PDF readers or image viewers. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.
Downloaded file won't open :: The file might be corrupted or wasn't generated correctly. Try downloading again. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.
File downloaded but doesn't display right :: Could be a download issue or a problem during processing. Check for errors or redownload. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.

# --- Even More Troubleshooting Details ---
The output file size is much smaller than I expected :: If the output file is significantly smaller than anticipated, especially after using the PDF Compressor or Image Converter (with quality settings), it might mean the quality settings were set too low (high compression), or (for PDF Compressor) the DPI was set very low. For batch processing, it could also mean some files failed to process and were skipped. Check your settings and the progress text for errors. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options` or `PDF Compression Preset options`.
Output file is too small :: Check your compression or quality settings; they might be set too low. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options`.
Expected larger file size :: Your chosen quality or DPI settings resulted in a high level of compression. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options`.

The output PDF has strange characters or rendering issues :: If the PDF created by Image to PDF, or the PDF compressed by PDF Compressor, shows characters or layout problems, it might be due to non-standard fonts, complex vector graphics, or issues with the original image/PDF content. The PDF Compressor, especially at low DPI, flattens everything, which can affect text/vector clarity. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?` or `What happens to image quality in Image to PDF?`.
PDF looks wrong after processing :: Could be rendering issues due to complex content or low DPI settings in Compressor. Ask about `How does PDF compression work here?`.
Text looks strange in processed PDF :: Low DPI in the Compressor flattens text; complex fonts in the original might also cause issues. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.

Processing stalled at the "Zipping results" stage :: If the progress bar gets stuck specifically at the stage where it says "Zipping results" or similar, it usually means the browser is struggling to create the final ZIP archive. This can happen with a very large number of output files (like splitting into many pieces, or a huge rotation sequence batch) or if the total size of the files to be zipped is very large. Try processing fewer files or using settings that generate fewer outputs. Ask about `Memory issues during processing` or `Tips for processing large files`.
Stuck at zipping :: Your browser might be struggling to create a very large ZIP file. Reduce the number of output files (process smaller batches, fewer pieces, shorter sequence). Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
Zipping stage is frozen :: This can happen with extremely large outputs. Try cancelling and reducing the batch size or output count. Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.

The eyedropper tool isn't working :: If clicking the eyedropper icon in the Chroma Key tool doesn't enable selection on the preview, or clicking the preview doesn't select a color, try refreshing the page and loading the image again. Ensure your browser isn't blocking JavaScript execution or interfering with mouse events on the canvas. Ask about `Using the eyedropper in Chroma Key`.
Eyedropper doesn't pick color :: Try refreshing the page or ensure your browser isn't blocking scripts. Ask about `Using the eyedropper in Chroma Key`.
Can't use the eyedropper :: Refresh the page and try again. Ask about `Using the eyedropper in Chroma Key`.

Cannot select files using Ctrl/Cmd or Shift :: If you are having trouble selecting multiple files by holding down `Ctrl`/`Cmd` or `Shift` in the file browser window, this is a function of your operating system, not the web tool. Ensure you are using the correct key for your system (Ctrl for Windows/Linux, Cmd for Mac) and that the files are in the same folder view. If issues persist, try adding files one by one, or select them all in your file explorer beforehand and drag-and-drop them onto the tool's input area if drag-and-drop is supported. Ask about `how to select files`.
Ctrl click not selecting multiple files :: This is an operating system function. Ensure you are using the correct key (Ctrl/Cmd) and the files are in the same folder view. Ask about `how to select files`.
Shift click selection not working :: This is an operating system function in the file browser. Ask about `how to select files`.

File list is not showing any files after selecting them :: If you select files using the 'Choose File(s)' button but nothing appears in the file list section, try selecting the files again. Ensure the files are in a supported format for the tool you are using. If the issue persists, there might be a browser issue or a problem with the file(s). Try refreshing the page or using different files. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

# --- General File Concepts (Brief explanations) ---
What is a JPG file? :: JPG (or JPEG) is a common image file format that uses lossy compression, meaning some data is discarded to reduce file size. It's widely used for photographs.
What is a PNG file? :: PNG is an image file format that uses lossless compression (no data is lost). It's popular for web graphics and supports transparency.
What is a WEBP file? :: WEBP is a modern image format developed by Google that supports both lossy and lossless compression, as well as animation and alpha transparency. It often provides smaller file sizes than JPG or PNG.
What is a GIF file? :: GIF is an older image format that uses lossless compression but is limited to a palette of 256 colors. It is commonly used for simple graphics and supports basic animation.
What is a BMP file? :: BMP is an uncompressed or minimally compressed image file format, often resulting in very large file sizes. It's a very basic format.
What is a HEIC file? :: HEIC (or HEIF) is a newer image container format often used by Apple devices. It offers more efficient compression than JPG, resulting in smaller file sizes for similar quality.
What is an AVIF file? :: AVIF is a very new image format based on the AV1 video codec. It offers high compression efficiency and supports features like transparency and HDR.
What is a PDF file? :: PDF (Portable Document Format) is a file format used to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.

What is resolution? :: In images and digital displays, resolution refers to the level of detail, typically measured in pixels (e.g., 1920x1080 pixels) or DPI (dots per inch) when referring to print. Higher resolution means more detail.
What is DPI? :: DPI stands for Dots Per Inch. It's a measure of spatial printing or scanning resolution, commonly used to describe the resolution of an image when printed on physical media, or the resolution at which a PDF page is rasterized into an image.

What is aspect ratio? :: Aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between an image's width and its height. It's usually expressed as two numbers separated by a colon (e.g., 16:9, 4:3, 1:1). Maintaining aspect ratio prevents images from looking stretched or squished.
What is compression? :: Compression is the process of reducing the size of a file. Lossy compression (like in JPG) removes some data permanently. Lossless compression (like in PNG) reduces size without losing any data, so the original can be perfectly reconstructed.
What is transparency? :: Transparency in an image or file means certain areas are not fully opaque and can allow content underneath to show through. PNG and WEBP image formats support alpha channel transparency.

# --- Extreme Expansion: Specific Errors & Fixes (Simulated) ---
Error: Invalid file signature :: This error means the tool tried to read the file but found that its internal identifier (signature) doesn't match the expected format, suggesting the file might be corrupted or misidentified. Try opening the file in standard software to check if it's valid. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
File signature mismatch error :: Indicates potential file corruption or incorrect file type. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

Error: Cannot read pixel data :: This error occurs when the tool can load the basic file information but fails to access or decode the actual image or page pixel data. This can be caused by file corruption, an unusual encoding variation within a supported format, or memory issues if the image/page is very large. Try with a different file or process a smaller batch. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Problem reading pixel data error :: Indicates an issue with decoding the image or page content. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

Error: Destination canvas too large :: This error occurs in image manipulation tools (like Rotate & Flip for non-90° angles, or Collage/Splitter if output dimensions are huge) when the calculated size of the output image canvas exceeds a browser or system limit. This is rare but could happen with extremely high-resolution inputs or complex transformations requiring vast output canvases. Try reducing input resolution or simplifying the task. Ask about `How rotation affects dimensions`.
Canvas too large error :: The calculated output image size is too big for the browser. Reduce input size or task complexity. Ask about `How rotation affects dimensions`.

Error: ZIP creation failed :: If this error occurs specifically at the zipping stage, it means the browser encountered a problem packaging the output files into a ZIP archive. This is often due to creating a ZIP with an extremely large number of files (like single pixel split on a large image) or an extremely large total size, which can hit browser or system limitations. Try processing fewer files or using settings that generate fewer/smaller outputs. Ask about `Batch download failed`.
Failed to create zip error :: The browser couldn't create the ZIP archive, often due to too many or too large output files. Ask about `Batch download failed`.
Zipping failed error :: Reduce the number or size of output files in the batch. Ask about `Batch download failed`.

Error: Page rendering failed :: This error in PDF tools (Compressor or PDF to Image) means the tool's internal engine was unable to convert a specific PDF page into an image. This can happen with complex or corrupted PDF pages, unusual graphics, or fonts. If processing a batch, note the page number or file mentioned and try removing that file or skipping that page range. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
PDF page failed to render error :: Indicates an issue specific to that page in the PDF. Try skipping it or using a different PDF. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Rendering failed for PDF page :: The tool couldn't turn that specific PDF page into an image. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

Error: File write error :: This error during download can occur if the browser is unable to save the file to your chosen download location. This could be due to insufficient disk space, permission issues with the download folder, or security software interfering. Ensure you have space and permissions for your downloads folder. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.
Error writing file :: Check disk space and folder permissions for your downloads folder. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.
Cannot save downloaded file error :: Your system might be preventing the browser from saving the file. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.

Error: Unknown file format variation :: Even within generally supported formats like JPG or PNG, there are sometimes unusual sub-formats or encoding variations (e.g., very old or very new/rare codecs, specific camera RAW formats saved with image extensions) that the browser or the tool's decoding libraries might not fully support. This can cause loading or processing errors. Try converting the file to a standard variation (e.g., open in MS Paint or a standard photo editor and save as a new JPG) before using the tool. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Unsupported format variation error :: The file uses an unusual type of encoding even within its format. Try resaving it using standard software. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Rare file type issue :: Some supported formats have variations the tool might struggle with. Resave the file elsewhere first. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

Wrong file format error on load :: The file type is not supported by the tool you are using. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Unsupported file type error on selection :: The tool cannot process files of this format. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

Error message "File is empty" or "Cannot read file" :: This could mean the selected file is genuinely empty (0 bytes) or there's a fundamental issue preventing the browser from accessing its content, possibly due to permissions, corruption, or the file being actively used by another program. Ensure the file has content and is not locked by another application. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Empty file error :: The file appears to have no content. Check the source file. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Cannot read file content error :: The browser couldn't access the file's data. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

Error message during processing mentioning "corrupted image data" or "decoding failed" :: This indicates an issue encountered specifically while the tool was trying to decode or read the pixel data of an image (either an input image or a page image generated internally like in PDF Compressor). This strongly suggests the input image/PDF page is corrupted or uses a very unusual/unsupported encoding variation. Try opening the file/image page in standard software. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.
Corrupted image data error :: The tool failed to decode the image pixels. The source file might be corrupted. Ask about `Common reasons for processing errors`.

# --- Additional Troubleshooting Queries (Mix of specific tools and general) ---
I can't get the Chroma Key eyedropper to work on the preview. :: If the eyedropper isn't sampling color from the preview, try refreshing the page and ensuring your browser is updated. Ask about `Using the eyedropper in Chroma Key`.
The Image Splitter preview isn't updating when I change rows/columns. :: In the Image Splitter tool, you must click the 'Update Preview' button after changing settings to refresh the visualization. Ask about `Update Split Preview`.
My Image to PDF won't put images in the order I want. :: In the Image to PDF tool, ensure you are rearranging the image thumbnails in the list after adding them. The final PDF order matches the list order. Ask about `Reorder Pages in Image to PDF`.
I converted an image to JPEG but it's still huge. :: When converting to JPEG, the output file size depends heavily on the 'Quality' slider setting. A high quality setting (closer to 1.0 or 100) results in a larger file. Try a lower quality setting for a smaller file. Ask about `Image Converter Quality Options`.
My compressed PDF looks blurry, especially the text. :: In the PDF Compressor tool, blurry text usually means you used a low 'Page Render DPI' setting. For sharper text, use a higher DPI preset (like 'Good Quality') or set a custom higher DPI in advanced settings. Ask about `Page Render DPI in PDF Compressor`.
I converted a PDF page to an image, but the transparent areas turned white. :: If you expected transparency when converting a PDF page to an image, ensure you selected an output format that supports transparency (PNG or WEBP) and checked the 'Transparent' background checkbox in the PDF to Image tool settings. JPEG doesn't support transparency. Ask about `Transparent background PDF to Image`.
The advanced batch rotation sequence only produced one file per image. :: In the Image Rotate & Flip tool's advanced sequence, ensure the 'Enable Rotation Sequence' box is checked and that your 'Start Angle', 'End Angle', and 'Angle Step' settings actually define a range with multiple steps (e.g., Start Angle is different from End Angle, and Angle Step is not zero). Ask about `Advanced Batch Rotation Sequence`.
My Image Splitter output pieces have different sizes. :: This is expected if the original image's dimensions are not perfectly divisible by the number of rows and columns you set. The pieces in the last row and last column absorb the remaining pixels. Ask about `How splitting works`.
The Image Rotate & Flip tool increased the size of my image after rotation. :: This happens when you rotate by an angle that is not a multiple of 90 degrees. The tool expands the canvas to fit the entire rotated image without cropping. Ask about `How rotation affects dimensions`.
I can't select files from a ZIP archive in this tool. :: Ensure the ZIP file contains supported image formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP, HEIC/HEIF, AVIF for Image tools; JPG, PNG, WEBP for Image to PDF). Only these will be extracted and listed. Ask about `What image formats can Image to PDF handle?` or `What image formats are compatible with the Collage tool?`.
The process is finished (100%) but the output ZIP is empty. :: This strongly suggests that processing failed for all selected files, or zero files were selected in the list. Check for errors during processing or ensure files were checked in the list. Ask about `Batch download failed` or `Select Files in List`.
I get an error message that mentions "memory" or "DOMException". :: This means your browser ran out of memory. Try processing smaller files, fewer files in a batch, or use simpler settings (like lower quality/DPI). Ask about `Memory issues during processing`.
The tool seems frozen and unresponsive. :: This often happens with very large tasks that consume too much browser memory or CPU. Try closing other tabs/applications or process smaller batches. If it's completely frozen, you might need to close and reopen the browser tab. Ask about `Processing is stuck` or `Memory issues during processing`.
My download button is active, but nothing happens when I click it. :: This is usually a browser-level issue. Ensure your browser isn't blocking downloads or pop-ups. Check your browser's download history. Ask about `Download troubleshooting tips`.
I see an error message during processing that names one of the files in my batch. :: The file mentioned in the error message is likely the source of the problem (corrupted, unsupported variation, etc.). Remove that specific file from the batch and try processing the rest. Ask about `Error with specific file`.

# --- Audio Cutter - Processing Logic ---
how does processing work :: Processing takes the original loaded audio and applies cuts or extractions based on the segments you have defined using markers or manual regions, according to the selected processing mode (keep or delete). It then generates a new audio buffer containing the resulting audio, which is encoded into a WAV file for download.
processing delete mode explanation :: In "delete" mode (either for markers or manual regions), the tool will *remove* the segments that are defined and selected for processing. All other parts of the audio will be kept and stitched together in the output.
processing keep mode explanation :: In "keep" mode (either for markers or manual regions), the tool will *only keep* the segments that are defined and selected for processing. All other parts of the audio will be removed. The kept segments will be stitched together in the output in the order they appeared in the original audio.
difference between keep and delete mode :: Delete mode removes the specified segments, keeping everything else. Keep mode keeps only the specified segments, removing everything else.
can I use both markers and manual regions for processing at the same time :: No, you process using *either* the segments defined by your marker pairs *or* the segments defined by your manual regions in a single processing step. You choose which set of segments to use based on which process button you click.
how does the tool handle overlapping segments :: If your defined marker pairs or manual regions overlap, the tool will merge them into continuous segments before processing. For example, deleting 0:10-0:20 and 0:15-0:25 effectively deletes 0:10-0:25. Keeping 0:10-0:20 and 0:15-0:25 effectively keeps 0:10-0:25. Keeping 0:10-0:20 and 0:30-0:40 keeps both distinct segments.

# --- Audio Cutter - Download Section ---
how to download the processed audio :: After the processing is complete and you are on the "Download Processed Audio" section, click the "Download WAV File" link.

button to load another file after processing :: Click the "Load Different File (Resets All)" button in the download section.

# --- Audio Cutter - Troubleshooting (I can't...) ---
I can't load my audio file :: If your audio file isn't loading after clicking "Choose Audio File", ensure it's in a common format like MP3, WAV, OGG, AAC, or M4A that your browser supports. The file might also be corrupted. Try loading a different audio file.
My audio file won't load :: Check if the file format is supported by your browser. Also, the file might be corrupted. Try opening it in a media player.
The loading indicator stays forever :: If the loader spins indefinitely, the audio file might be too large for your browser to handle, or it could be corrupted or in an unsupported format causing the decoding to fail. Try a smaller file or a different format.
I can't play the audio after loading :: If the audio loads but won't play when you click ▶️, ensure your browser's sound is not muted and your system volume is up. There might also be an issue with the file itself or its encoding that prevents playback in the browser.
The audio player is silent :: Ensure your volume is up. If other audio works in your browser, the specific audio file might have an issue, or perhaps the abstract waveform is misleading and the audio is genuinely silent in parts.
I can't set the start marker :: Ensure you have loaded an audio file and the player is ready (duration is shown). You can set the start marker while playing or paused.
I can't set the end marker :: Ensure you have already set a start marker. The end marker must be set at a time point *after* the start marker.
The end marker time doesn't save :: When setting the end marker, make sure the time you are setting is after the currently set start marker.
I can't add a marker pair to the list :: Ensure you have set *both* a valid start time and a valid end time, and that the end time is after the start time.
The 'Add This Marker Pair' button is disabled :: This button is enabled once you have set both a start and an end marker time, and the end time is after the start time.
I can't add a manual region :: Ensure you are typing valid numerical values or M:SS.ss format into both the start and end time input fields. The end time must be later than the start time and within the audio duration.
The 'Add Manual Region' button is disabled :: This button is enabled when you have entered valid numerical or time format inputs in both the start and end time fields.
I can't add a note :: Ensure you have loaded an audio file and typed some text into the note input field.
The 'Add Note' button is disabled :: This button is enabled when you have loaded an audio file and entered text into the note input field.
I can't process using markers :: Ensure you have added at least one marker pair to the "Defined Marker Pairs" list. If you selected "Process Red" or "Process Green", ensure there is at least one pair in the list tagged with that action type.
The 'Process Using Markers' button is disabled :: This button is enabled when you have loaded audio, and you have at least one marker pair defined in the list.
I can't process using manual regions :: Ensure you have added at least one region to the "Additional Manual Regions" list.
The 'Process Using Manual Regions' button is disabled :: This button is enabled when you have loaded audio, and you have at least one manual region defined in the list.
Processing stuck at a percentage :: If the process bar is not moving, the browser might be encountering a memory issue with a very large file or a complex segment to process. Try cancelling and restarting, possibly with a different audio file or by processing fewer/smaller segments.
Processing fails with an error message :: If you receive an error, check the error message displayed for clues. Common issues are related to the original audio file's integrity or complexity, or hitting browser memory limits. Try processing a different file or simpler segments.
Processing uses too much memory / Browser crashed :: Processing audio, especially large or high-sample-rate files, can consume significant browser memory. If your browser crashes or shows an out-of-memory error, try processing a smaller audio file or limit the number/length of segments you are trying to process at once.
The processed audio is silent :: If you processed in "Keep" mode and the result is silent, it might mean the segments you defined to keep were actually silent parts, or no segments were successfully kept. If you processed in "Delete" mode and the result is silent, it means you marked the *entire* audio as segments to delete. Review your defined segments and processing mode.
The processed audio is too short/long :: The length of the output audio depends on the segments you defined and the processing mode (keep/delete). Review the segments in your list to ensure they cover the correct parts of the audio.
I can't download the processed audio :: Ensure the processing completed successfully (loader is gone, status says success). If so, the "Download WAV File" link should be active. If clicking it does nothing, check your browser's download history and settings; it might be blocking the download.
The download link is disabled :: The download link becomes active only after the processing is successfully completed. Check the status message for errors during processing.
Downloaded WAV file won't open or is corrupted :: This might indicate an issue occurred during the final processing or WAV encoding step. Try processing the audio again. If it fails again, there might be an issue with the original audio file or the processing settings used.

# --- Additional Troubleshooting - Audio Cutter ---
I can't click the process button in the Markers tab. :: The "Process Using Markers" button is enabled when you have loaded an audio file and have added at least one marker pair to the "Defined Marker Pairs" list. Ensure the list is not empty.
I can't click the process button in the Manual Regions tab. :: The "Process Using Manual Regions" button is enabled when you have loaded an audio file and have added at least one region to the "Additional Manual Regions" list. Ensure the list is not empty.
My processed audio is very short / almost empty. :: If you used "Keep" mode, you might have only selected very short segments, or the defined segments were invalid/overlapping in a way that resulted in minimal audio to keep. If you used "Delete" mode, you might have accidentally defined almost the entire audio as segments to delete. Review your defined segments and processing mode.
My processed audio still contains the parts I wanted to delete. :: Ensure you selected the correct processing mode ("Delete" for the list you used) and that the segments you defined accurately cover the parts you wanted to remove.
My processed audio is missing parts I wanted to keep. :: Ensure you selected the correct processing mode ("Keep" for the list you used) and that the segments you defined accurately cover all the parts you wanted to keep. If using "Delete" mode, make sure the parts you wanted to keep were *not* accidentally included in the segments marked for deletion.
The abstract waveform doesn't match the audio. :: The abstract waveform is a simplified visual representation of overall loudness and might not perfectly reflect every nuance or silence point, especially for quiet audio. It's meant as a general guide; rely on the time displays and listening for precise marking.
The time display seems inaccurate. :: Ensure your browser is not under heavy load from other tasks, which could affect timing precision. For most purposes, the time display should be accurate based on the audio file's metadata.
I added markers/regions/notes but they disappeared when I reloaded the page. :: This tool does not save your project data (markers, regions, notes) if you close or refresh the browser tab. They are stored only in the browser's temporary memory during your current session.
I added markers/regions/notes but they are gone after processing. :: Processing audio and going to the download section does not clear your editor data. However, if you click "Load Different File (Resets All)" or "Clear All Data & Load New File", it *will* clear all your markers, regions, and notes.
I can't edit the start/end times of a marker pair or region after adding it to the list. :: Once a marker pair or manual region is added to its list, you cannot directly edit its start and end times. You must delete it from the list and add a new one with the corrected times. You *can* edit the text of a note.
Can I click on the abstract waveform to jump to a time? :: No, the abstract waveform itself is visual only. To jump to a time, click or drag the progress bar (#audioProgress) located directly below the waveform display.
Can I click on the time display in the lists to jump to that point? :: Yes, you can click on the time range displayed for a marker pair or manual region, or the time for a note, in their respective lists, and the audio player will jump to that time point.
The download link is active, but clicking it opens a new tab with gibberish. :: This can sometimes happen if the browser tries to *display* the WAV file instead of downloading it. Right-click on the "Download WAV File" link and choose "Save link as..." or "Download linked file" to force a download.
The processed audio sounds distorted or crackles. :: This is less common, but might indicate an issue during the processing or encoding step, potentially related to browser resources or the original audio file's sample rate/bit depth. Try processing again with a different audio file if possible.
The player controls (play, skip) are disabled. :: These controls are disabled until an audio file is successfully loaded into the tool. Ensure you have loaded an audio file.
